Then there is rudeness and that is yet another thing: that too should be eradicated and fought. I suffer acts of rudeness every time I go to the bench.”</p><p>A DAZN journalist then challenged the 65-year-old, saying it wasn’t abuse of an individual but their ethnic origin.</p><p>“Look, you are completely off track,” he replied. “You are very wrong to say such a thing. It's a rude chorus aimed at a single player.</p><p>“And then the boo aimed at teams that have black players? Racism must be fought but not confused. We must not make the mistake of lumping everything together because otherwise it's all racism and it's wrong.”</p><p>Gasperini then walked away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifKe7zq2ZmqScZH51fZZubm5nmqrDprrTrqpmnKWorq951aWYoaemnrBurs6oop6cXZiyrbHBq5itoZ%2BjeqK4y56enpxdp66ktdKtZJqapaiycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
