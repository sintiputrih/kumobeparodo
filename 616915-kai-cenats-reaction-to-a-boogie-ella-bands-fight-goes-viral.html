However, this isn’t the first time Cenat has been caught up in a hip hop couple’s spat.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in November, his Twitch Livestream with Blueface and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chrisean Rock</a> became an instant viral moment. At one point in the interview, Chrisean picked up a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">folding chair and threw it </a>at Cenat’s wall, leaving a large hole. Elsewhere in the episode, the tumultuous couple forcibly removed Kai from his chair so that the “Thotiana” rapper can sit in it.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Aside from the couple's chaos, Cenat’s year was full of wins. In October 2022, he became the most subscribed Twitch streamer at the time. That same month, he fulfilled another dream by purchasing his mom a brand home.</p><p>“I officially accomplished the ONE goal I’ve always dreamed of as a kid,” he tweeted. “Moving my family out of the hood. Now I’m here closing on my Mom’s first house OF MANY at the age of 20. BLESSINGS.”</p><p>The 21-year-old star is also in talks to have his very own Fortnite Tournament.
