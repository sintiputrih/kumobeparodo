A somewhat surprising twist that some fans thought might mean her run in <strong><a href=#>NJPW</a></strong> was already coming to an end. A further twist presented itself shortly after that as Mone was one of four competitors announced in a tournament to crown the first-ever NJPW Strong Women's Champion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-njpw-strong-women-s-title-tournament-final>The NJPW Strong Women's Title Tournament Final</h2><p>Mone was undoubtedly the favorite to win the match and become the inaugural Strong Women's Champion, but we now may never know if that was the original plan. Mone progressed to the final at Resurgence on Sunday, but what appears to be a pretty serious injury suffered by the wrestler formerly known as Sasha Banks seemed to result in the match needing to be cut short.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mercedes Mone Claims She's A Female Version Of The Rock</a></span></p><p>Mone jumped from the ring apron to the floor, hurting her ankle when she landed. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PWInsider</a>, word backstage at the show is that Mone suffered a broken ankle. An injury that will keep her sidelined for a while if that is what has happened. Mone was competing against AEW's Willow Nightingale who went on to win very quickly after the injury, taking the Strong Women's Title in the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=willow-nightingale-is-your-first-champion>Willow Nightingale Is Your First Champion</h2><p>Although Mone hasn't clarified whether her ankle has broken or not, she has provided an update on the situation from a hospital bed. Attaching a short video in which she can still be seen in her wrestling gear, Mone apologized to fans for the match ending the way it did and promised she will be back better than ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nothing beyond Resurgence had been confirmed for Mone, but with her competing back in the US, on a NJPW show, and against an AEW star, it wouldn't have been out of the realms of possibility for her to be <a href=#>penciled in for a match against Nightingale at Forbidden Door 2</a>. If that was the plan, that match will naturally not be happening if Mone really does have a broken ankle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmedmr%2BkscOeqmaln6OybrXNo6yrnZRiu6u81maqraqfo7Ruw86mnKerXam2tbjEZqSarJOdfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
