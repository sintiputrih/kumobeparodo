His erratic behavior gave way to a range of fan theories, with many wondering about what might be the real reason behind his lack of composure. So, are the rumors anything to go by? &nbsp;Does Gus have a drug addiction?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Gus from 'Floribama Shore' on drugs?</h2><p>"On Thin Ice" captured an outing to an ice skating rink. Things quickly took a new turn after Aimee, Candace, Gus, and others started screaming uncontrollably at each other. It appears that it was Gus who sparked the conflict. He likely wanted to have a one-on-one with Nilsa about a past rumor that ultimately brought <a href=#>h</a><a href=#>is relationship with Lisa</a> to an end.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In an after-show special, several cast members called him out on his poor timing.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gus, it just wasn't the time and the place for that. That's why we, the ladies got mad," Candace told Gus in a clip titled "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">after shore - on thin ice</a>."&nbsp;</p><p>To make matters worse, Gus also tried to start a fight with resident hunk Jeremiah in the same episode. Anxious fans flocked to Twitter to ask further questions about the potential reasons behind Gus's hotheadedness.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>"Is Gus on drugs???

In another scene, Gus will have to take the heat for ostensibly stealing a hairdryer. As the 20-second-long clip shows, he will try to stand up for himself, which won't yield the desired results. In the end, Gus will opt for a different strategy, departing from the scene by means of running.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you thought sh*t went down this week... weelllll!!
