He did send me the pictures and I was like, ‘You don’t send a guy pictures like this in your underwear.'”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Jokes aside, Wahlberg had plenty of nice things to say about the “Sorry” singer, 22. “He was proud, you know, it was a big deal for him to do,” the <i>Departed</i> star, who posed for Calvin Klein during his “Marky Mark” days, said. “And I was like, I am at 45,&nbsp;a dad and a husband, a father of four, I’m trying to move away from that image. But you know what? People give him flak for growing up in the spotlight and they say he has a bit of an attitude, but look at the look on my face, I mean, I was the biggest punk in the world. He’s very nice and young and polite compared to what I was.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>Noting Wahlberg’s cocky facial expression in his ad, the host, 53, said, “You look like you’re just causing yourself pain! That is the face you make when you squeeze your sack like that.” To which the actor replied, “Well, I can’t say I [haven’t] done worse things, but yeah, that wasn’t one of my proudest moments.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2FCtMDIp2SboZWXsrN50p6lrWWdlr%2Bsedaan6Walae0brTIrGSco12qu6Wx0bCcmqpdlrG0edZtbWlxaWZ8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
