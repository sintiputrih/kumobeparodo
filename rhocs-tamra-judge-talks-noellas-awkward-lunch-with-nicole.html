It seemed very contrived to me. She’s doing a lot. She’s doing a lot of extra stuff,” Brandi said, adding that Noella “didn’t seem intoxicated” to her.</p><p>As for <a href=# rel=noopener>Noella and James’ split</a>, Tamra said the breakup happened as <a href=# rel=noopener>RHOC season 16</a> was filmed — and that she heard James “didn’t want to film.” She also noted that Noella and James were allegedly living in Puerto Rico together when she learned <a href=# rel=noopener>she had been cast</a>.</p><p>“They were living in Puerto Rico. He didn’t just buy the house. They were living in Puerto Rico, had been there for a while, because there was pictures and videos of them on Instagram of them there. I was even invited to that house. And then she got hired and I heard that he said, ‘This is not going to be good. We have too many issues. This is not going to be good for my career,’” Tamra alleged.</p><p>According to Tamra, Noella returned to her and James’ Newport Beach rental after being chosen for season 16.</p><p>“I think it is a lot. And I feel like, as a viewer, it’s [<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Gina Kirschenheiter</strong></a>]’s situation all over again. She comes in, <a href=# rel=noopener>instantly gets divorced</a>. We never see <a href=# rel=noopener>the husband</a>. We never see the kids. How do we get invested in a story that we only see one side of?” Tamra wondered.</p><p>Also on the podcast episode, Tamra shared an odd detail about her interaction with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Denise Richards</strong></a> post-<a href=# rel=noopener>Brandi affair rumors</a>.</p><p>“She called me when that happened,” Tamra revealed. “When she got home [from Rome] she called me. And she’s like, ‘I didn’t do it. It didn’t happen.’ She says she has text messages.”</p><p>“I don’t know why she called me,” she added.</p><p><strong>RHOC&nbsp;Live Viewing</strong>&nbsp;– This is also the live viewing thread for tonight’s new episode of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Orange County&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">season 16</a>, which airs at 9/8c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqpiksLR505qkq5ldn8Kls8Rmq5qkm6h6r7vEpaOaq12WxKzDwKubZqSlo7Cpedaiq6Flnp6wsLjEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
