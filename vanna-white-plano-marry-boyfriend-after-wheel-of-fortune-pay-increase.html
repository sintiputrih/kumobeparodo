Vanna’s children will definitely be a part of the ceremony, the insider added.</p><p>"Vanna wants to show her appreciation for this wonderful guy who's been so patient,” they continued.

During their marriage, they welcomed two children into the world: daughter Gigi, 27, and son Nikko, 29. Vanna began <a href=#>dating her current partner in</a> 2012 after an acquaintance introduced the President of JDC Construction + Development Group to White at a barbecue she was hosting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanna-once-said-she-rsquo-d-likely-never-marry-again>Vanna Once Said She’d Likely Never Marry Again</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vanna-white-pat-sajak.jpg><p>Vanna’s decision to walk down the aisle again may come as a surprise to some fans. Lat fall, the 67-year old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told PEOPLE she didn’t feel like</a> she needed to get married considering how long she and her beau have been together.</p><p>"I mean, we've been together 12 years, and I feel like we are married," she said. "Do we have to get married? No, because we feel comfortable in our relationship. You know what I mean? I know that he's the one. He knows I'm the one."</p><p>"We don't really talk about it, but you never know," she continued. "I mean, I guess we could, but in my eyes and his eyes, we are married."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vanna’s change of heart may have been motivated by her experience <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">renegotiating her Wheel of Fortune salary</a> for an undisclosed amount in the millions. After Ryan Seacrest was announced as Pat Sajak’s replacement, it was revealed he was being offered a much higher salary than Vanna was currently getting, despite being with the show for two decades. In fact, reports said she hadn’t seen a pay increase in over a decade, despite Sajak’s finishing salary being much higher.</p><p>Vanna quickly lawyered up, but she was able to renegotiate with the network and is staying on with Wheel of Fortune for the foreseeable future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGitmqaelnq4tMitnGaonJa7sHnMmqmrsV2XvLqy0aKcp5xdlrO1sdFmrqGdlaF6sLKMn6arrKWjsm68wLJkoqaTp7Kiv8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
