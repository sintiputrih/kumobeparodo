Their eldest, now eight years old, is often featured on both their Instagram pages and Chrissy has been open about the lessons she wants to teach her daughter.</p><p id=eHi7IdL5vNm data-wc=49>"She is a bit of a perfectionist which I didn't know I was until the past few years," the mother-of-dour told PEOPLE. "I'm trying to tell her that not everything has to be perfect and there is joy and beauty in imperfections, and don't be so hard on yourself."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eec72d2c9e20-luna-stephens.jpg><h2>Miles Theodore</h2><p id=eP_-1KAXMIv data-wc=35>Two years and one month after welcoming their daughter, Luna, John and Chrissy said hello to their eldest son, Miles Theodore, on 16 May. Chrissy revealed the news on Instagram at the time: "Somebody's herrrrrrre!"</p><p id=eEsUh26sXEt data-wc=72>Miles is now six and, judging by the photos shared on social media, is clearly a happy little boy and his mom is teaching him to "embrace" his emotions. In 2020, Chrissy said of her son: "I think that's really important in this world. That it's okay to cry, and it's okay to be upset about something or to be sad about something. We're going to talk it through and it's okay."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d4988a6ffa8b-john-and-miles.jpg><h2>Chrissy and John's devastating loss</h2><p id=e7pduCCAY7h data-wc=47>Two years after welcoming baby Miles, Chrissy and John shared the devastating news that they had suffered a pregnancy loss. They told the world of the heartbreaking news on Instagram, explaining that they had to say goodbye to their son, Jack when Chrissy was 20 weeks pregnant.</p><p id=eqW9WRrq7BL data-wc=56>"We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we've never felt before," shared Chrissy on social media. "We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn’t enough," she added.</p><p id=e9WcBJ31u7C data-wc=56>John also said at the time: <strong>"I didn't know that we could experience this grief and also share it, but when we did, it really meant so much to so many people</strong> and it was such a powerful experience for me to learn that. I'm just grateful that my wife was courageous enough to do it."</p><p id=edPMqU_75wd data-wc=21>Chrissy and John both have tattoos in honor of their baby boy and planted a tree of life in their home.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<h2>Esti Maxine</h2><p id=eB5xNrUC17M data-wc=70>In January 2023, John and Chrissy announced the happy news that they had welcomed their second daughter, Estie. "She's here! Esti Maxine Stephens - the house is bustling and our family could not be happier," Chrissy said on Instagram, adding: "Daddy sheds nightly tears of joy seeing Luna and Miles so full of love, and I am learning you still need diapers with a c section!? We are in bliss."</p><p id=e6poKp9oaei data-wc=69>Before Esti was born, the parents shared the news in August 2022 that they were expecting their rainbow baby. <strong>"The last few years have been a blur of emotions to say the least, but joy has filled our home and hearts again.</strong> 1 billion shots later (in the leg lately, as u can see!) we have another on the way."

Chrissy announced the news writing: "We want to say thank you for this incredible gift you have given us, Alexandra.

Chrissy previously told PEOPLE: "For me, the hardest part is making sure the older ones feel loved and taken care of and just as special as the babies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/55573433e366-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-four-children.jpg><p id=eG5grYA-DAmF data-wc=42>"There's a lot of diaper changing and feeding and it seems like you're coddling these two little babies and they're not getting enough.
