Damage control has followed, <strong>with X (formerly Twitter) banning fans</strong> from accessing the content on their platform – for example, if you search "Taylor Swift leak," you'll be redirected. It's no secret that <a href=#>loyal Swift fans</a> have been patiently waiting (and some perhaps not so patiently) for the release date, <strong>but is accessing the leaks online ethical? This question has been posed by TikToker Splotchmaker</strong>, who<strong> </strong>has encouraged other Swifties to share their opinion, and it is proving to be a heated topic.</p><h2 id=what-has-been-said-about-taylor-swift-39-s-album-leak>What Has Been Said About Taylor Swift's Album Leak?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some Taylor Swift fans realize how problematic it is for the musician to have snippets of her music released before <a href=#>the official due date on April 19, 2024</a>. Others disagree and feel they should be allowed to listen because it's their way of showing their support. Enter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikToker @Splotchmaker</a>, who recently posted a video discussing the leak.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-s-15-most-popular-songs-spotify-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's 15 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's top Spotify streams will likely be changing since she announced her new album, 'The Tortured Poets Department' will be released soon.</span><p>"Taylor Swift's album got leaked and people are either listening to the leaks or trying to publicly shame and/or execute people for listening or spreading leaks," Splotchmaker says. "So, I want to pose a silly little question: Where do you think the ethical line is here?" They then explained the two scenarios and the feedback they have been seeing, noting how "on the one hand, people are saying respect the artist, respect the art, it comes out in one day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The other side of the argument is, "People are saying she's a billionaire. This won't take away any meaningful income, meaningful streams, and she's still going to break a ton of records." However, it is clear from the comment section that fans cannot agree.</p><h2 id=what-have-fans-said-about-the-ethical-dilemma-they-face-over-taylor-swift-39-s-leaked-album>What Have Fans Said About The Ethical Dilemma They Face Over Taylor Swift's Leaked Album?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-6.jpg><p>In the hours since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Splotchmaker posted her video</a>, there has been a reaction reflecting both sides of the argument. A Taylor Swift fan had this to say on the topic: "My opinion, it's not money or the records broken but the fact that she worked so hard for this music and is giving us so many easter eggs/clues leading up to the release and someone else just leaks it." <strong>This is a valid point, as Swift is believed to have worked on this project for about two years</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I kept working on it throughout the U.S. tour, and when it was perfect — in my opinion, when it's good enough for you — I finished it, and I am so, so excited that soon you'll get to hear it," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told fans during the performance</a> of her Eras Tour in Japan in early February 2024, per Los Angeles Times.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has penned plenty of hits, but how many songs has she written in total?</span><p>Another commenter agreed that the issue is about respect, writing, "It doesn't matter if streams or sales go down a little bit, people need to be patient and have the same respect for other artists as they do for major artists." <strong>However, some fans feel they have waited long enough and spent enough money on Swift's prior albums, so listening to the leaks will not cause any damage</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I bought 14 copies, imma listen to the leak," one comment reads. "I already pre-ordered eight copies of the album, and I'm going to buy one more. I'll listen to the leaks if I want to!!" another shared. <strong>But now the question is where you fall: Should accessing the leak be no big problem? Or does it show a lack of respect for Taylor Swift?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroqOkpLimvoyaqqSrXaG2tMDEp6Cnn12prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8FuusSwZJqkkqq6brjEmqJmrZ6awam1wpqjZp6Ro8BusMivoJ2dlGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
