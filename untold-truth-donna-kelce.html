Ahead of the "Kelce Bowl," the siblings asked their mom to share her life story on their podcast "<a href=#>New Heights</a>" in February 2023. When the topic of her father, Donald Roy "Don" Blalock, Sr., came up, Donna described him as a "narcissist." Proof of this, she said, was Don's decision to name both her and her brother, Donald R. Blalock, Jr., after himself. Donna revealed that her dad also had a son named James much later in life; her younger half-brother is just two years Jason's senior.</p><p>According to Donna, her father struggled with monogamy but kept getting hitched; by the time he died in 2018, he'd given marriage a shot with five different women. When Jason asked his mom if Don was a faithful husband, she said, "Of course not. He's a narcissist."</p><p>Donna also helped clear up some confusion Jason had about his grandfather's past. He'd seen a report saying Don had committed treason, but Donna explained that the crime he was accused of was actually "industrial espionage." According to a 1981 <a href=#>Cleveland Plain Dealer</a> report, he got arrested for allegedly stealing blueprints from an equipment manufacturing company where he used to work. However, Donna said that he was never convicted of the crime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxgboF6f46upa2nnJl6tb7UrZ9mnJ%2Bju6J5yp6jnJ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
