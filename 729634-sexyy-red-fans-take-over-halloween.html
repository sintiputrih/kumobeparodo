In celebration, <a href=# rel>the "Pound Town" performer</a> recently took to social media, telling fans to drop their Sexyy Red costumes. It's safe to say that she wasn't disappointed, as countless social media users responded with their Sexyy-inspired fits.</p><p>She reposted some of her favorites, and a few of them are seriously spot-on. <a href=# rel>"Yall snappin wit yall costumes of me,"</a> Sexyy Red wrote. According to her, however, there was one clear winner. She reposted a clip of YouTuber Heather Sanders showing off her costume, which perfectly emulates Sexyy's BET Hip Hop Awards look from this year.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Sexyy Red Net Worth 2023: What Is The Rapper Worth?</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sexyy-red-tells-fans-to-drop-their-halloween-costumes>Sexyy Red Tells Fans To Drop Their Halloween Costumes</h2></span><p>Sanders even captured the rapper's iconic "Big Sexyy" chain. "She winnin so far yall," Sexyy Red wrote alongside a heart-eyes emoji. It appears as though the "Shake Yo Dreads" performer's fans have taken over Halloween, and if there wasn't already a run on bright red wigs, there will be soon. Sexyy herself has been <a href=# rel>embracing spooky season</a> for some time now, rocking devil horns in a variety of her recent Instagram photos.</p><p>She hasn't always appreciated others taking notes from her distinct style, however. Earlier this month, Latto shared a video of herself throwing it back alongside friends in a pair of True Religion jeans. Latto's denim sparked controversy, with many claiming that she was jacking Sexyy's look. Fuel was only added to the fire when the "SkeeYee" artist reposted a fan's Instagram Story, which appeared to throw shade at Latto. "All these celebrities wasn't wearing @truereligion until @sexyyred came out üò≠üò≠," the post read. Despite speculation, the St. Louis native denies any beef. <a href=# rel>‚ÄúDefinitely not shading her I‚Äôm direct wit it whatever I gotta say,‚Äù</a> she wrote.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everyone-s-dressing-like-sexyy-red-this-year>Everyone's Dressing Like Sexyy Red This Year</h2></span><p>What do you think of Sexyy Red's fans <a href=# rel>dressing like her</a> for Halloween?
