Previously, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYNda0VuHUD/?img_index=8">revealed</a> that 2021, the year they got together, had been a year that "brought [her] more into the present moment than [she has] ever been."</p><p class=dh>During that time, she steered clear of social media, which helped her spiritual, emotional, and mental health.
