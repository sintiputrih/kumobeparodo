"My sister Jackie was very special to me â€” she was my big sister, so <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she definitely acted like it</a>," said the rapper. "She was a real tough cookie, such a loving and caring person, [and] she was the captain of the ship up until she was no longer able to be it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The&nbsp;Jes Us 4 Jackie Foundation was launched when Nelly and his family were on the quest to find bone marrow donors for his sister, and while she wasn't able to be helped, the rapper said seven other people found matches. Nelly said it was "one of the worst days of my life" when he found out his sister had passed away, but in her final days, he made sure she knew that he would&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">take care of her children.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"She would definitely have a chuckle about me dancing," Nelly added. "Dancing to one of Jackie's favorite songs is dope. I miss Jackie an awful lot, I miss Jackie every day."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
