In September 2023, Crawford and other legendary stars debuted a show on AppleTV+ called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Super Models</a>. In the first episode, Cindy revealed a guest appearance on a popular show that struck a nerve with her years later.</p><h2 id=years-ago-oprah-made-cindy-crawford-very-uncomfortable-on-her-show>Years Ago, Oprah Made Cindy Crawford Very Uncomfortable On Her Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-cindy-crawford-ever-forgive-oprah-for-treating-her-like-chattel-during-an-interview-on-her-show_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the earliest stages of her modeling career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cindy Crawford appeared as a special guest on The Oprah Show</a>. At one point during the interview, <a href=#><strong>Oprah</strong></a> praised Crawford's body. In addition to complimenting how her body looked, Oprah also asked her to stand up so that everyone could admire her.</p><p>At the time, Crawford went along with it and didn't object to the ask. It wasn't until some time later that it occurred to her why the request had always nagged at her.</p><p>With an increased focus on body positivity and scrutiny against body-shaming, asking a young woman (Crawford was 20 years old at the time of the interview) to stand up so others could check her out and see how great her body is wouldn't be seen as acceptable in the present day.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cindy-crawford.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cindy Crawford Reveals The Real Reason She Posed For Playboy, Despite Her Manager Telling Her It Would Ruin Her Career">Cindy Crawford Reveals The Real Reason She Posed For Playboy, Despite Her Manager Telling Her It Would Ruin Her Career</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Cindy Crawford was one of the most high-profile models of the '90s, but her decision to pose in Playboy wasn't supported by everyone.</p><p>In addition to commenting on her body, Oprah asked the modeling agency representative who escorted Crawford on the show whether any "grooming" needed to occur before she was ready for the runway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the word didn't carry so much weight in 1986 when the interview was recorded as it does now, combining that statement with the uncomfortable analysis of her body and a follow-up conversation about her weight gives the whole interview an awkward feel.</p><h2 id=cindy-called-oprah-out>Cindy Called Oprah Out</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar49093254.jpg><p>In 2023, during an episode of The Super Models, Cindy Crawford used the opportunity to vocalize her upset at the experience she had on Oprah's show and why it was inappropriate. The model states that the request to stand up and show everyone her body made her feel like she had to prove herself worthy of being there and being part of the industry, <a href=#>comparing the experience to being chattel</a> and not a person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/does-kaia-gerber-s-modeling-salary-eclipse-what-her-mother-cindy-crawford-was-paid-when-she-was-the-same-age_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Does Kaia Gerber's Modeling Salary Eclipse What Her Mother Cindy Crawford Was Paid When She Was The Same Age?">Does Kaia Gerber's Modeling Salary Eclipse What Her Mother Cindy Crawford Was Paid When She Was The Same Age?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kaia Gerber is a beloved model just like her mother Cindy Crawford, and it's possible that she is making even more money than her famous mom did.</p><p>While Oprah's team pulled the interview from her official YouTube channel after pushback came from Cindy Crawford's statement, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it can still be found on her website</a>. Responses from Oprah Winfrey's inner circle have displayed disappointment over the delayed response, including a snippet from her best friend, Gayle King.</p><p>Many feel that the comments were inappropriate because Oprah herself is so outspoken in the public eye about the effects of body shaming and making others feel insecure about their size.</p><p>Since <a href=#>Cindy Crawford's daughter, Kaia Gerber</a>, is now in the modeling business, many wonder if her motherly instinct has influenced the change of heart. Taking on such intrusive requests and questions is something in and of itself, but thinking about your child going through the same actions and uncomfortable emotions is another element of the situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cindy-crawford-might-have-forgiven-oprah-later>Cindy Crawford Might Have Forgiven Oprah Later</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/tt_web_how-does-kaia-gerber-feel-about-being-constantly-compared-to-her-mother-cindy-crawford-_bk_a1.jpg><p>Despite the awkward interview, Cindy Crawford and Oprah continued to have a relationship for many years. Crawford appeared on Oprah's show ten times during her career and was also part of various celebrations to honor the talk show host.</p><p>Many think that Cindy Crawford forgave Oprah early on for the blunder. However, others feel that realizing the issue's depth didn't fully resonate until decades later.</p><p>Modeling is a highly competitive job, with many aspects that can reduce a person's opportunities for work. Therefore, the young stars are more apt to please, giving in to whatever request they think will help bolster their success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Cindy Crawford, there were <a href=#>certain elements that made her self-conscious</a> about her future in the industry and likely made her more agreeable to outlandish requests and questions she fielded on Oprah's show.</p><p>In general, people change as they age. What they found appropriate in the past may no longer be the case as they get older. This change is common across the board, with people finding themselves switching political affiliations, their taste buds enjoying foods they once hated, or even entering a career force they never saw themselves part of. It's safe to say that the person Cindy Crawford was in 1986 at the age of 20 is not the same individual that provided the interview on AppleTV+ in 2023.</p><p>Fans may never know whether it was an "aha" moment or a long-standing emotion that she compressed for many years. However, with the different climate towards such inquisitions, it's likely models won't have to entertain such questions again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmLavsNhmmquZp5u8s7CMsJisZaWlwKbAjLCgraBdpL2zrcdo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
