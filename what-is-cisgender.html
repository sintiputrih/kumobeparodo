Plus, they share tips for exploring your own gender, which (spoiler alert!) they recommend everybody try!</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cisgender, A Definition</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Put simply, cisgender is a word for someone's gender aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth, explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jesse Kahn, L.C.S.W., C.S.T.</a>, director and sex therapist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>The Gender & Sexuality Therapy Center</a> in NYC. Important: Cisgender is an adjective, not a noun, they say. Meaning, someone is not 'a cisgender'. They're a cisgender man, cisgender woman, or cisgender person.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Confuzzled by some of the terms in the above definition? Let's clarify. Gender refers to a set of behaviors, interests, and roles that society uses to put you in the "woman", "man", "non-binary" or "other gender" box. Basically, gender is the way a person moves through the world, and what they wear as they do it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also known as someone's natal sex, sex assigned at birth is a label given to newborns (and sometimes fetuses) based on factors like hormones, genitals, and chromosomes. Doctors use this info to put 'male' or 'female' on the birth certificate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(Worth knowing: About <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>one percent</a> of people are born intersex, meaning they have sex characteristics that do not neatly nearly into neither the male or female box, says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Rae McDaniel</a>, a non-binary licensed clinical counselor and gender and sex therapist based in Chicago. Sadly, most doctors wait to fill out the birth certificate until the newborn has undergone treatments that force them into one of two categories).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Someone is cisgender when they are man and were assigned male at birth (AMAB), or when they are a woman and were assigned female at birth (AFAB).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Katarina Radovic/Stocksy</span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cisgender vs. Transgender</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Transgender is the word used when someone's gender does not align with their assigned sex at birth. "The prefix 'trans' means on the other side of," explains McDaniel. So someone is transgender if they have a gender that is on a different side of their sex assigned at birth, they say.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Need some examples? Think about trans-celebrity Elliot Page, who was assigned female at birth and is a man. Or Laverne Cox who was assigned male at birth and is a woman!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the record: Both of these Netflix stars are what would be considered binary trans people. "Someone whose gender is not aligned with their sex assigned at birth and does fit neatly into the 'man' or 'woman' box is a binary trans person," explains McDaniel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Someone whose gender is not aligned with their sex assigned at birth and does not fit neatly into those boxes — for instance, is non-binary, agender, genderqueer, to name just a few non-binary trans identities — is known as a non-binary trans person, they say. (Think: Demi Lovato or Jonathan Van Ness). The more you know!</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How Do I Know If I Am Cisgender?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You are cisgender if your gender correlates to the sex you were assigned at birth, and gender your parents assumed you were and raised you are," says Kahn. "For example, if when you were born and the doctors were like "it's a girl!" and you grow up to be a woman, you're cisgender," he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to pleasure-based, queer- and polyamory- inclusive sex educator and sex-positivity advocate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Lateef Taylor</a>, most cisgender folks never ever question their gender. So if you've never thought, "Wait, am I actually a girl??" or felt like your gender was a too-tight pair of jeans, odds are you are cisgender. (Yes, even if you've never heard this identity term until now!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If, however, you don't feel like the gender you've been living in is the "right" gender, you may not be cisgender. In this instance, Kahn notes that there are a variety of words you might use to name your lived experience and gender. Including non-binary, transgender, non-binary and transgender, or any other gender identity term.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4 Tips For Exploring Your Gender</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Critically exploring your gender, and questioning how you want to dress and express yourselves is beneficial to everyone," says McDaniel. So no, these tips aren't just for non-binary and transgender folks!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Doing so can help people across the gender spectrum experience a kind of gender freedom," they say.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>1. Give yourself a Gender 101 course.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Start by educating yourself on what gender is, various gender terms such as non-binary and transgender, and what the differences are between things like gender identity and gender presentation," suggests Kahn. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Gender Reveal</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>En(ba)by</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Queery</a> podcasts are all good sources for this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(FTR: Gender presentation and gender expression encompasses things like how you dress, act, talk, and walk and it does not have to match your gender identity).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>2. Interrogate your own preconceived notions.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond just educating yourself on the terminology, "it's important to also reflect on your familiarity with, relationship to, and underlying judgments and assumptions of the people and communities that embody these identities, expressions, and experiences," says Kahn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While we all have judgments, and it's OK that we do, he says, "we do need to be aware of and work to unlearn, not perpetuate, those judgments."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One way to unlearn those judgments is by following people across the gender spectrum on Instagram. Another way is to consume memoirs by non-binary, transgender, and gender non-conforming folx. I recommend starting with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Amateur</a> by Thomas Page McBee and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Sissy</a> by Jacob Tobia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>3. Do some deep thinking.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Better yet, grab a journal. Then, Khan suggests jotting down thoughts on questions like: What does gender mean to me? How might I describe my gender? What words resonate for me? What's my gender presentation and how does that differ or feel aligned with my gender?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>4. Focus on what brings you gender joy.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Often, says McDaniel, when people talk about how to explore your gender there's a lot of attention on what clothing, expectation, and roles make you feel icky. How un-fun!. "But rather than focusing on all the things that make you feel bad, it can be helpful to think about what things make you feel good," they say. (Things that make you feel good in your gender are often known as gender euphoric).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your job: Make a list of all the articles of clothing, activities, chores, colors, hairstyles, and makeup #lewks that make you feel gender bliss. Then, lean into them and continue leaning into them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme9ahmK1lmah6pLXSoJynnJWn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
