Now, let’s introduce you to Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bV66Xap_pjlx0f-300x201.webp><h3>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s Early Life:</h3><p>Regarding where he spent his childhood, our research points to Altona. This is a small town in Hamburg, Germany – also known as Hamburg-Altona.</p><p>Also, in our research, we found that Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s Mother gave birth to him in Asklepios Clinic, Altona.</p><p>The above Clinic, where his parents had him, is a teaching hospital of the University of Hamburg. Until 2005, we knew this health institution as General Hospital Altona.</p><p>Choupo-Moting was brought up in a Christian Religious home which has a German/African cultural mixture.</p><p>The Hamburg-born Cameroon international fell deeply in love with the game during his boyhood years.</p><p>According to those who were acquainted with Choupo-Moting (during his early years), his soccer ball (which he played for fun) was a natural extension of his legs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/qtugrHq.jpg><p>The youngster began playing football in Ottensen, a small neighbourhood in the district of Altona, Hamburg.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/h9QzAIx-300x200.webp alt="Andres Iniesta Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><span class=monsterinsights-inline-popular-posts-label>Trending</span><a class=monsterinsights-inline-popular-posts-title href=#>Andres Iniesta Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts</a><p>Because Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s parents had their family home close to a small soccer pitch, life became easier. The small field gave him the opportunity to learn his early football tricks.</p><h2>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting Family Background:</h2><p>The first thing to know about members of his household is the fact that they (his parents) are very enthusiastic about football.</p><p>Regarding what Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s Dad does for a living, research has it that Mr Just Moting is a retired Cameroonian basketballer.</p><p>Truth be told in this Bio, it was hard for the former Basketballer to deal with retirement.</p><p>To keep his sporting dreams alive, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s Father vowed to make his son carry on with the family’s greatness on the fields. Is there any resemblance between Dad and Son?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ufCWl0L-300x200.webp><p>Although Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s Mum appears discrete in public affairs, we believe she is a very good homemaker as well as a football fan.</p><p>In fact, both of his parents were responsible for Eric’s humble beginnings, resourcefulness, and his spirit of reverence.</p><h2>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting Family Origin:</h2><p>He always sees himself as a Baller with two hearts. Those words define Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s nationality.</p><p>Put simply, the Soccer player is a Cameroonian (from his father’s side) and a German (from his Mother’s side).

Choupo-Moting’s Father has his ancestry from the Central African country (Cameroon).</p><p>From a football perspective, when you think about Cameroon, you’ll likely remember names like <span><a href=#>Samuel Etoo</a></span> and Roger Milla.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/k2g4oR9.jpg><h3>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s Ethnicity:</h3><p>Judging from the origin of his parents, you can best call him an Afro-German or Black German.</p><p>This ethnic classification describes people of Sub-Saharan African descent – who are citizens or residents of Germany.

Choupo and Maxim understand each other without words.</p><p>Both, who are on the same wavelength, have been together for 15 years and counting (from the time of writing his Bio).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/h9QzAIx-300x200.webp><h2>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting Biography – Football Story:</h2><p>At six, in the year 1995, the youngster began playing soccer in his hometown.</p><p>Eric Maxim began his football academy career with the youth of FC Teutonia 05, a small club in the town of Ottensen, Hamburg. The academy helped him lay a good career foundation.</p><p>Early on, Just Moting began equipping his son for the future. Aside from being at a soccer academy, he made Eric attend Gymnasium Altona, which has rich sporting facilities.</p><p>Just Moting, as seen here, never took any of his son’s early sporting development for granted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/L24A6Y2-1024x751.jpg><p>At the dawn of the new millennium, Choupo-Moting left Teutonia 05 for Altona 93, another great football academy. While there, he won his first youth cup.</p><p>He only stayed with Altona 93 – for three years – before getting a move to FC Sankt Pauli in the year 2003.</p><p>The year 2004 was when everything got serious for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. That year, he joined Hamburg SV Academy, which is by far the biggest football club in his city.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NSZ11Pf-300x201.webp alt="Son Heung-min Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><span class=monsterinsights-inline-popular-posts-label>Trending</span><a class=monsterinsights-inline-popular-posts-title href=#>Son Heung-min Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts</a><p>Three years into their Academy, Eric got promoted, and he became a professional footballer.</p><h2>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting Bio – Road to Fame Story:</h2><p>Just maybe you never knew Hamburger SV was such a great Bundesliga team in the late 2000s.</p><p>While at the German club, Choupo-Moting played alongside <span><a href=#>Vincent Kompany</a></span>, <span><a href=#>Jerome Boateng</a></span>, Rafael van der Vaart, etc. He also played alongside Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was nearing his retirement.</p><p>Back in the day, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting was like a schoolboy to Ruud van Nistelrooy.</p><p>The Manchester United Legend took him under his wings, and both had a formidable partnership in Hamburger attacks. At 21, Eric Choupo-Moting left Hamburger for greater challenges.</p><h3>The Fax Machine Story:</h3><p>During the Bundesliga 2010/2011 season January transfer window, Choupo was supposed to make a switch to FC Koln.</p><p>However, that transfer didn’t work out because of a technical defect in a fax machine. Now, let’s tell you what actually went wrong.</p><p>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s Father and adviser played their role in faxing the completed contract to FC Koln at 5:49 pm.</p><p>Unfortunately, only one page of the contract arrived at its destination. The main page which has Choupo-Moting’s signature, reached Koln by 6:13 pm.</p><p>Because of a 13-minute delay, the transfer failed. FC Köln then lodged a complaint with the DFL, stating that a technical defect with a Fax machine prevented them from meeting the transfer deadline.</p><p>Sadly, the club’s appeal of the failed transfer was not considered.</p><p>Funny enough, Moting also suffered from another tech issue ten years later. This time, it involved him, his Dad (Just Moting), Bayern Munich, and Cameroon’s national team.</p><p>An Online source revealed that <span><a href=#>email address controversy prevented Choupo-Moting</a></span> from joining his Indomitable Lions squad.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/MXyoPaU-300x200.webp alt="Sadio Mane Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> </a><span class=monsterinsights-inline-popular-posts-label>Trending</span><a class=monsterinsights-inline-popular-posts-title href=#>Sadio Mane Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts</a><h3>Club career Struggles:</h3><p>The ages of 21 to 26 are supposed to be the most important years in a professional footballer’s life.</p><p>Top strikers – the likes of <span><a href=#>Kylian Mbappe</a></span>, <span><a href=#>Christopher Nkunku</a></span>, <span><a href=#>Darwin Núñez</a></span>, <span><a href=#>Dusan Vlahvoc</a></span> can attest to that. Sadly, that wasn’t the case for Choupo-Moting.</p><p>After a failed loan move to FC Nürnberg, he accepted a transfer to Bundesliga side 1. FSV Mainz as a replacement for <span><a href=#>André Schürrle</a></span>.</p><p>Choupo-Moting played in a team that had <span><a href=#>Liverpool</a></span> FC reject <span><a href=#>Loris Karius</a></span> and a 37-year coach – in the person of <span><a href=#>Thomas Tuchel</a></span>.</p><p>With a poor goal-per-appearance ratio (20 goals in over 70 appearances), Kasper Hjulmand, who coached FSV Mainz after Tuchel, sold Choupo Moting to Schalke 04.</p><p>If you are a passionate football lover, you’ll know that Choupo-Moting joined a very good German team.</p><p>At that time, Schalke 04 had big youngsters.

Moting was also in a great team that had <span><a href=#>Breel Embolo</a></span> and <span><a href=#>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg</a></span>, etc.</p><p>Similar to his performance with Mainz, Choupo-Moting did not do so well at Schalke despite having the above big names around him.</p><p>Although, the German Cameroonian did score his first Bundesliga hat-trick and a couple of goals (with acrobatic celebrations), as seen here.</p><p></p><p>Following his inability to impress the club, Choupo-Moting’s Schalke contract, which expired at the end of the 2016/17 season, wasn’t extended.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/xbmeEYV-300x201.webp alt="Mesut Ozil Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><span class=monsterinsights-inline-popular-posts-label>Trending</span><a class=monsterinsights-inline-popular-posts-title href=#>Mesut Ozil Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts</a><p>The Hamburg native, who was yet to have a trophy in his career, decided it was time for another change in his career.</p><h3>Moving abroad for the first time – with Stoke City:</h3><p>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s parents supported their son’s decision to continue his football career outside of Germany.</p><p>Among the suitors that came for Choupo were Stoke City FC, a club that played in the Premier League (at that time). Just Moting (Eric’s Dad) made the deal happen.</p><p>On 7 August 2017, a three-deal free transfer to Stoke took place after the English club approved the departure of <span><a href=#>Marko Arnautovic</a></span> and <span><a href=#>Bojan Krkic</a></span>.</p><p>With Stoke, Choupo Moting played alongside the likes of <span><a href=#>Peter Crouch</a></span> and <span><a href=#>Xherdan Shaqiri</a></span> – as forwards.</p><p>Thanks to his new confidence, a bright start to Moting’s Stoke City career led to goals – especially against <span><a href=#>Jose Mourinho’s</a></span> Manchester United.</p><p>More interestingly, an unforgettable bromance between Choupo Moting and <span><a href=#>Kurt Zouma</a></span> formed a huge highlight of days at Stoke City.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/lifebogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/bWEcOd5_czzscn-300x200.webp><p>Although Stoke City suffered shock relegation from the Premier League that 2017/2018 season, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting’s impact on that season was greatly appreciated.</p><p>Now, here is a video of his goals at Stoke, including that famous dance he had with Kurt Zouma.</p><p></p><h2>Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting Biography – Success Story:</h2><p>Similar to <span><a href=#>Joselu</a></span>, the Spanish Forward, the greatest turnaround in Choupo-Moting’s club career finally came.

Even as a second Striker, Moting impressed Thomas Tuchel by scoring these goals for PSG.</p><p></p><p>Following years of disappointment, all the Cameroonian footballer (just like <span><a href=#>Pablo Sarabia</a></span>) wanted was to win a trophy in his career.</p><p>With PSG, he won four titles in the space of two seasons.
