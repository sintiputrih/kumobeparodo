There have been allegations of internal power struggles and factionalism within the party, leading to divisions among party members. These controversies have presented significant challenges to Abure’s leadership, requiring him to navigate complex political dynamics within the party. The Labour Party (LP) is currently embroiled in a crisis, with conflicting factions led by Barr Julius Abure and Lamidi Apapa.
