Editing and other techniques can increase a sense of drama with any reality series, but one would assume the bulk of the action happened. After all, the show primarily deals with the central team tracking down cars to touch up and sell, and those cars do actually exist, so they must have fixed them somehow.</p><p>Creator and cast member Marcos “Scooter” Carrera spoke with KFOX14 to discuss why he wanted to make the show and what it meant to him. He mentioned, “I’m extremely proud of the Borderland and I want the whole world to see it the way I see it, which is kind of what the theme of the show is.” And at least one of the buyers comes from El Paso, too. Episode 2 of the series featured KFOX14 photojournalist Richard Zamora and his daughter, Hazel, as they searched for a car for her. Zamora ultimately bought her a 1966 Ford Mustang GT, which also lends some credence to the series. Zamora stated, “My daughter, she’s into classic cars and she loves these classic Mustangs, so crazy that we ran into a nice Mustang on this show.”</p><p>For all intents and purposes, “Tex Mex Motors” is likely the real deal. It’s always possible certain aspects were exaggerated, like the Mexican police scene mentioned by one Redditor. But until something else comes to light, this show is authentic and a must-watch for gearheads.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cLrErZ2loaioerWx12aknrBdory1u9GsZLCgqWKxsHnSqGSmmZ6uerGxzqmjnmWknbavt4yiq6xllpa4pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
