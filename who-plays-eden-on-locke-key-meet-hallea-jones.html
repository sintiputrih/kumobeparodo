But in Season 2, the character — and the actress — get a massive upgrade. So, wondering who plays Eden on&nbsp;Locke & Key? And what else there is to know about Hallea Jones (oops, spoiled who plays Eden, sorry about that)? Read on.</p><h2>Who is the&nbsp;Locke and Key Eden Actress?</h2><p>So, fun fact: sometimes SEO searches aren’t in proper English. But that’s okay! We don’t judge! So if you’re searching Google for “who is the Locke and Key Eden actress” we’ve got you covered. Her name is Hallea Jones. Pronounced “huh-lee-ah,” she hails from Toronto, Canada, which is where the sound-stages for Locke & Key are located. Was she born on those sound-stages? Probably not!</p><h2>Where have I seen Hallea Jones before?</h2><p>Her first credited role is as Jess, the pilates instructor from a 2018 episode of&nbsp;Workin’ Moms. She also appeared in two episodes of&nbsp;The Hot Zone as “Anita” and one episode of&nbsp;The Boys as “Older Girl.” In addition, she appeared in the all-Netflix-star holiday movie&nbsp;Let it Snow as Madison. But you probably know her best from her role as Eden Hawkins on&nbsp;Locke & Key.</p><h2>Who is Eden Hawkins on&nbsp;Locke & Key?</h2><p>I’m going to assume you’re here because you’re watching&nbsp;Locke & Key and want to know who plays Eden, but just in case you’re here because you were searching for “who plays Older Girl on&nbsp;The Boys,” I’ve got you covered. In the first season of&nbsp;Locke & Key, Eden is introduced as a star in the making (or at least in her own mind). She’s mean to everyone, particularly Kinsey Locke (Emilia Jones), who is new in town.</p><p>By season’s end, Eden has somewhat redeemed herself, and teamed up with the rest of the town’s kids to try to take down the big bad guy, Dodge (Laysla de Oliveira). While doing that, Eden gets hit with a “bullet” shot out of something called The Black Door, and infected with a demon. The only person who knows this is Gabe (Griffin Gluck), a local teen who is dating Kinsey. Except unbeknownst to everyone except Eden, Gabe is also secretly… Dodge. Bum ba BUM.</p><p>As we enter Season 2, Eden and Gabe/Dodge are teamed up for nefarious reasons that don’t become totally clear until towards the end of the 10 episodes. But in the meantime, Eden gets to stretch her wings by eating everything in sight (including a dude’s face), and generally clashing with everyone from Gabe to the Locke family. She also falls out a window once, and it’s very funny.</p><h2>What else should I know about Hallea Jones, who plays Eden on&nbsp;Locke and Key?</h2><p>Great question, person who came here searching for “who plays pilates instructor Jess from&nbsp;Workin’ Moms?” In addition to acting and modeling, Jones is also working on her music career, and posts frequently on both <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>Twitter</a>.
