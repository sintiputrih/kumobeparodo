While Chantel's family questioned Pedro's motives, Pedro's family expected him to send them money back home. Oh, and there was the<a href=#>&nbsp;epic fight that broke out</a> during a family dinner between Pedro, Chantel's brother River, and <a href=#>Pedro's sister Nicole</a> that made for one heck of a reality television episode.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, the couple landed a spinoff titled&nbsp;<a href=#>"The Family Chantel,"</a>&nbsp;a series that dives deeper into the problems both families face as well as how the couple continues to navigate married life.&nbsp;</p><p>In Season 3 of "The Family Chantel," Pedro was on a quest to find the father that abandoned him, which led him to meet his half-brothers for the very first time. However, per&nbsp;<a href=#>All About the Tea</a>, fans reportedly uncovered a photo on Instagram that showed Pedro and Chantel with his two half-brothers in 2014... which was way before the season filmed. Many viewers weren't happy about feeling misled, but the show carried on.&nbsp;Per a TLC press release, Season 4 of "The Family Chantel" landed a premiere date of June 6, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWplZ353e8Waop6rpGLAtbvRopysZZ%2Bjenp8jJ2YsmWWnq6vr8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
