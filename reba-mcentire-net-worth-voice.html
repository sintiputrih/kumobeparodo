While primarily a country music singer for the first 15 years of her long-running career, she branched out to movies in the '90s, Broadway and sitcoms in the 2000s, and judging and coaching on one of television's most popular singing competition shows in the 2020s.</p><p>From her first single, 1976’s "I Don't Want to Be a One Night Stand" to releasing her breakthrough album, 1984’s My Kind of Country, starring in horror comedy favorite Tremors to her long-running sitcom Reba, playing Annie Oakley in Annie Get Your Gun on Broadway to being on three of the biggest shows of this decade, Young Sheldon on CBS, <a href=#>Big Sky</a> on ABC and <a href=#>The Voice</a> on NBC, Reba has thrived in the public eye for decades.

For someone who's on a massive network television show, has a sitcom still in syndication, and sold over 75 million records, that amount isn't at all surprising.</p><p>First and foremost, Reba is a country music singer. Over 100 of her singles have charted on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart. 25 of those have hit number 1. From her excellent covers, 1990's "Fancy" and 1991's "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia," to original songs like 1993's "Does He Love You" and 2001's "I'm a Survivor" (which you might recognize as the theme song from Reba), she has been able to get country music radio play for over four decades.</p><p class="sc-bA-DUxO bSiVrH"><span>Reba McEntire</span></p><p class="sc-jVSHhB eSHvkk">Singer, actor, judge on 'The Voice'</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $95 million</p><p style=text-align:start>Reba McEntire is a country music singer and television star.
