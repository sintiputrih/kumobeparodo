Over the years, Nolan’s films seemed to be increasing in visual spectacle to accompany his impressive narratives. The British director has even ventured into the world of IMAX with The Dark Knight in 2008, and his latest film, <a href=#>Interstellar</a>, appears to be pushing the boundaries of the mammoth movie format.</p><p>Interstellar‘s visual effects supervisor Paul J. Franklin recently posted two images to his <a href=#>Twitter account</a> — which has since been taken down — of how Christopher Nolan is using the IMAX technology for his upcoming film. Apparently Nolan strapped a 200-pound IMAX camera to the nose of a jet plane. This technique will surely produce some mind-blowing POV shots.<span id=more-79246></span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/interstellar-imax-camera-jet-02.jpg alt=interstellar-imax-camera-jet-02 width=578 height=432 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Christopher Nolan is no stranger to spectacle. In his last film, The Dark Knight Rises, the film’s opening sequence involved an elaborate kidnapping that included a smaller airplane being captured by a larger airplane while in midair. It’s curious to see how Nolan will top The Dark Knight Rises, in terms of big action stunts and set pieces, but from the looks of the IMAX jet plane, Nolan seems to be working on something gigantic.</p><p>A few months ago, Christopher Nolan signed a deal with <a href=#>IMAX Entertainment</a> that will allow the director to shoot more of his movies with the technology. With The Dark Knight, Nolan shot 28 minutes of footage in IMAX for the film’s final cut, while for The Dark Knight Rises, he shot 72 minutes of IMAX footage. It’s believed that Nolan may shoot upwards of 90 minutes of Interstellar‘s running time using IMAX cameras. Nolan might make the first movie to be completely shot in the IMAX format.</p><p>As for Interstellar, Steven Spielberg was originally attached to direct the sci-fi film, but ultimately it fell into Christopher Nolan’s lap. The details of the film’s story are still a bit vague, despite Paramount releasing an official plot synopsis: “A group of explorers make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.” Scuttlebutt also says that Interstellar will involve <a href=#>parallel dimensions</a>, and could involve <a href=#>climate change</a> as well.</p><p>Interstellar features a world-class cast of actors and Christopher Nolan regulars, including <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Matthew McConaughey" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Matthew McConaughey</a>, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, David Gyasi, Wes Bentley, Mackenzie Foy, Timothée Chalamet, Topher Grace, David Oyelowo, Ellen Burstyn, and (of course) Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan co-wrote the screenplay for Interstellar with his writing partner and brother, Jonathan. The film is based on the writings of theoretical physicist/astrophysicist Kip Thorne, who is serving as the film’s creative consultant and executive producer. Nolan is producing the film with his producing partner and wife, Emma Thomas, along with producer Lynda Obst.</p><p>Interstellar will hit theaters everywhere on November 7, 2014, in IMAX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvCoamiq6Skvamx0WalqKSRo3q0wNGap6mdlGK2rq3XZpqapZWnrm62xK1kqaSRo7Jutc2tnKurpJq5ra3RZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
