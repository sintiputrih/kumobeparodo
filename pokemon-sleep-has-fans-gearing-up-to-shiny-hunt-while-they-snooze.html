The ability to catch Shiny Pokemon was revealed when an image was leaked online displaying each adorable creature that would be collectible at launch ‚Äî featuring Shiny variants.</p><p data-injection=true>Now that players are aware of Shiny Pokemon being in Pokemon Sleep, they are preparing to do something that many humans do best ‚Äî sleep. Pokemon Sleep players will be able to catch Shiny Pokemon simply by sleeping and allowing the mobile app to track their cycle throughout the night.

While players probably won‚Äôt be allowed to run more than one Pokemon Sleep account, similar to Pokemon Go, it is funny to think about.

Or are these backups from the dusty drawer we all have?</p><p data-injection=true>In the comment section, other players shared their excitement, and Shiny finds. One player shared a picture of their Shiny Bulbasaur, which they caught on their first night of using the app. Another comment shared information letting other Trainers know that the Snorlax that players raise weekly can also be Shiny, but this is rare. They shared a picture of the big snuggly Pokemon with sparkles around it.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Sleep Will Have Battle Passes & Fans Aren‚Äôt Stoked</a></p><p>With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokemon Sleep rolling out in Australia</a>, Canada, Latin America, and New Zealand already, it won‚Äôt be long before everyone worldwide begins getting better sleep and being rewarded with Shiny Pokemon.
