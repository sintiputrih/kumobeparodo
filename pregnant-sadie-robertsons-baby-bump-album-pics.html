I am not pregnant,’” the Louisiana native explained to Us. “And I, like, walked out of the room and started doing my makeup and actually had an interview in 10 minutes. So I go back and I look at the test and it was positive. I was like, ‘What?’ I started crying and laughing. Like, I was just like so shocked … and very, very excited.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Whoa That’s Good” podcast host added that she thinks Huff will be a great girl dad since he is “very sweet [and] affirming.” She gushed, “I just feel like this little girl is going to know she’s beautiful and wonderful and be very confident and set and who she is.”</p><p>The pregnant star is in “love” with her bump, she went on to say. “I couldn’t wait for it to pop.
