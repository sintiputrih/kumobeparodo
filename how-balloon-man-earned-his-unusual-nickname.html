When he visited doctors, they told him that he didn't have a tumor. But, surgeries in the 1800s were still considered too risky for the young patient.</p><p dir=ltr>J.W. joined a dime museum in his early '20s. The museum called him the "<a href=#>Balloon Man</a>" and "Wind Bag," and let people view J.W.'s distended abdomen. Unfortunately for J.W., being unable to move his bowels caused quite the buildup in his guts, according to ​​<a href=#>MDLinx</a>. His colon was filled with many extra pounds of excrement that had accumulated.</p><p>If J.W. had been born today, he probably would have had a much easier life. His condition was considered untreatable at the time, per the Mütter Museum. About 1 in every 5,000 to 8,000 babies born will have Hirschsprung's disease, but today, doctors know the signs to look for. The disease can be present from birth, and if a baby shows signs of a distended stomach or chronic constipation from birth, doctors can begin a treatment plan, according to the <a href=#>Mayo Clinic</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCElmlub2lfnby4ecGao6Wnn6N6rq3NZpyaqp6asW60yKxkrqalqMKiuIynoJyjnpa6pns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
