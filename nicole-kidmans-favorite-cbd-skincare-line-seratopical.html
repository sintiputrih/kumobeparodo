So, while I loved the products, I loved even more that I was joining a company that I had the same values around women in business as I do.”</p><p>As for the <a href=# rel=noopener>products&nbsp;Kidman&nbsp;swears by</a> from the Seratopical by Sera Labs line, she shared that she loves the Rapid Soothing Pain Creme, and always carries it in her <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a>. “[I]&nbsp;love how easy it is to apply. It’s not messy at all,”&nbsp;Kidman&nbsp;said.</p><p>Her other favorites include&nbsp;some of the newer products like the Overnight Hand Therapy, Love Your Eyes Anti-Aging Serum&nbsp;and Radiant Glow Facial Oil.&nbsp;She’s also a fan of the Cracked Heel Souffle, which instantly improves cracked, dry heels and rough skin on the bottom of the feet. Products from the line contain 100mg-300mg CBD and other all-natural ingredients,&nbsp;such&nbsp;as manuka honey, coconut oil, and essential oils like peppermint and lavender.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-CBD-Skincare-Line-That-Nicole-Kidman-Swears-By-Inline-1.jpg><p>The&nbsp;Big Little Lies actress is going to be more than just the face of the brand — unlike previous endorsement deals, she’s going to actually be “working on product development and creating products that are solution-based,” Duitch shares.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Follow along on Seratopical’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> to see the wife of country crooner <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Keith Urban</strong></a> trying out the products herself.
