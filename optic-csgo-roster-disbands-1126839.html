The Houston Outlaws are operated as a distinct entity from the other Overwatch team, LA Valiant. And the iconic OpTic name will remain in CoD as a Los Angeles franchise.</p><p>[ad name=”article2″]</p><p>That left the OpTic CS:GO roster, at the time owned by the same company who owned the MiBR team and brand. Immortals announced at the time of the acquisition that they would divest in the OpTic CS:GO team, and since then were working to find the roster a proper home.</p><p>But the OpTic roster are now saying that enough is enough, and Kristian ‘k0nfig’ Wienecke announced on Twitter that the roster was disbanding and that the players are seeking new opportunities as individuals.</p><p>[ad name=”article3″]</p><p>“We have chosen to disband the OpTic lineup because there is no future in OpTic,” k0nfig wrote. “I’m ready to be sold individually. I strongly feel like this is the best choice.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm honestly sad that the situation ended like this. I really love playing with <a href=#>@MSL</a> and <a href=#>@OfficialnikoCS</a> but there is no future because their contract is far longer than mine and OpTic wouldnt let us buy any players/give them contracts. It has all been a waiting game.</p><p>— Kristian Wienecke (@k0nfigCS) <a href=#>October 11, 2019</a></p><p>[ad name=”article4″]</p><p>K0nfig expressed regret that the situation has unfolded the way it has, and heaped praise on both Mathias ‘MSL’ Lauridsen and Nikolaj ‘niko’ Kristensen, but regrettably he says there is “no future” with them “because their contract is far longer than mine and OpTic wouldn’t let us buy any players/give them contracts.”</p><p>Just before k0nfig made his announcement, MSL posted on Twitter that he was voluntarily benching himself and looking to move forward from OpTic.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have decided to bench myself. When I joined Optic, the plan was to build a strong team and buy out strong players, but because of optic getting sold, that changed and we have constantly been in a position where we couldn’t build a proper team. 1/2</p><p>— Mathias Lauridsen (@MSLcsgo) <a href=#>October 11, 2019</a></p><p>[ad name=”article5″]</p><p>K0nfig is referring to players René ‘TeSeS’ Madsen and René ‘cajunb’ Borg when he mentions OpTic not handing out contracts. Both players have played under the OpTic banner in recent months, but not under full-time contracts. TeSeS <a href=#>announced on Twitter</a> that he too is seeking new opportunities, and North announced that they have signed cajunb all on the same day.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I can show the guys how we can approach things"</p><p>Today we welcome <a href=#>@cajunbCS</a>. He brings a lot of experience, discipline and ideas to the team. Welcome home, René! :blue_heart:<a href=#>#HearTheRoar</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kUUViwDC30</a></p><p>— North (@TheNorthIsHere) <a href=#>October 11, 2019</a></p><p>A day prior to the disbanding, October 10, k0nfig <a href=#>went on Twitter</a> and expressed his frustrations with the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>“What do you expect honestly? We haven’t had a days pracc or anything. We are in a fucked situation all the fucking time…I hope that we can get some closure on this contract situation in the near future because this isn’t helping us perform. It’s always in the back of our heads.”</p><p>All four now-disbanded OpTic players k0nfig, MSL, TeSeS, and niko are now seeking opportunities with new organizations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbHXnqmtp16YvK57wqyeqGefpcGqr4ycqqCnXae8tMDEq2SdoaOXrq%2Bw0mZoampmbYB6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
