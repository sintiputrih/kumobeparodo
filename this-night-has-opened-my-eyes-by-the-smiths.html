The picture was taken at the renowned Brixton Academy on that memorable night of December 12, 1986. Oh, how vividly that evening remains etched in my memory. We were both radiating with excitement, adorned in our finest attire, eagerly anticipating The Smiths’ live show featuring the complete band lineup.</p><p>As the night unfolded, a magical moment unfolded before our eyes. The band took the stage, and their performance of ‘This Night Has Opened My Eyes’ enveloped us in its brilliance. The haunting vocals, mesmerizing guitar melodies, pulsating basslines, and rhythmic drums created an atmosphere that resonated deep within our souls. It was a sublime experience, one that made every second spent in that crowded venue absolutely worthwhile.</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<p>Since that night, I’ve longed for the chance to attend another concert by The Smiths, but fate has yet to grant me that opportunity. Nevertheless, the memories and emotions evoked by that singular performance continue to inspire me. That photograph in our living room is not merely a snapshot frozen in time; it’s a symbol of our shared love for The Smiths and the profound impact their music has had on us, forever reminding us of that extraordinary night when we witnessed The Smiths’ brilliance firsthand.”</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-amanda-london-says>AMANDA LONDON says:</h5><p>“There’s an inexplicable allure in the ominous vocals and ethereal atmosphere of ‘This Night Has Opened My Eyes’. It carries a sense of melancholy and sadness, yet there’s a profound calmness and acceptance that lingers. The line <strong>‘I’m not happy and I’m not sad</strong>‘ encapsulates this complex emotional state perfectly. Every element, from the vocals to the guitar, drums and bass blends together flawlessly, creating an almost flawless composition. It’s no wonder that ‘This Night Has Opened My Eyes’ holds a special place in the hearts of the average Smiths’ fan. It has become a favorite among many, capturing the essence of the band’s unique appeal.”</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nancy-says>NANCY says:</h5><p>“There’s a particular line in the song that strikes me with an immense force every time I hear it: ‘<strong>the dream has gone, but the baby is real</strong>‘. It’s a moment that encapsulates the abrupt shift from a blissful, idealized existence to the harsh realities of life. The jolt of realization, the acceptance that this is the path one must tread—it’s truly remarkable. This song, without a doubt, stands as a masterpiece, and The Smiths showcased their brilliance as both storytellers and songwriters. The composition itself is a fusion of complexity and smoothness.</p><p>The synergy between Marr’s instrumental prowess and Morrissey’s distinctive vocals is unparalleled, a match made in musical heaven. Their combined talent creates an incomparable experience that leaves an indelible mark on fans and listeners. Yet, as much as I admire their artistry, I find myself yearning for the immortality of the entire band. Alas, it remains but a dream. May we pay our respects to Andy Rourke, whose recent passing on May 19, 2023, marks the end of an era. As a legendary member of The Smiths, his contribution to their music will forever be remembered. Rest in peace, Andy Rourke, a true icon whose legacy will endure.”</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kojo-enoch-says>KOJO ENOCH says:</h5><p>“I was beyond lucky to witness Morrissey perform ‘This Night Has Opened My Eyes’ live for the first time since the demise of The Smiths. The performance in question took place in August of 2021 at the Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. The experience was overwhelmingly beautiful. I actually cried with immense joy throughout the performance and after. And to think that I almost didn’t buy tickets for that show! Another beautiful highlight of that night was seeing Alain Whyte brilliantly take the traditional place of Boz Boorer on guitar. And my goodness, he did so much justice to it! It was nice seeing Whyte being a member of Morrissey’s band again.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-hatful-of-hollow-album>The “Hatful of Hollow” Album</h3><p>On the 12th of November, 1984, English rock band, <a href=#>The Smiths</a>, released a compilation album with the title, “Hatful of Hollow”.</p><p>The band welcomed assistance from the following record producers in the production of the album:</p><ul><li>John Porter</li><li>Roger Pusey</li><li>Dale “Buffin” Griffin</li></ul><p>London based Rough Trade Records and Warner Music Group’s Sire Records were responsible for the release of the album.</p><p>This compilation album spent 46 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 7.</p><p>In 2000, it was placed at No. 44 on music magazine, Q’s “100 Greatest British Albums Ever”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvNoKSemZ6eu6i%2FwKebn5mTqcBvr86mZq2gmah6r7XGoatmoJGoerC8xKecnWWdrnqmxcSsZJuxXam1pnnSpqCtoKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
