In the upcoming 'RHONY' Season 14, viewers will be introduced to a whole new set of women who are much younger and come from diverse backgrounds compared to the original cast.</p><p>The new lineup includes Sai De Silva, Ubah Hassan, Erin Dana Lichy, Jenna Lyons, Jessel Taank, and Brynn Whitfield. Notably, influencer Lizzy Savetsky was initially announced as a full-time cast member last year during BravoCon, but she later left the series due to criticism related to her religious beliefs. But before we dive into the juicy drama, let's take a closer look at one of the cast members, Ubah Hassan.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who is Ubah Hassan?</h2><p>Ubah is a fashion model from Canada, although she was born in Somalia in 1987. When she was little, her mother and sisters left Somalia because of the war and went to Ethiopia. Ubah and her father stayed in Somalia until 1994, and then they moved to Kenya. When Ubah was fifteen, she moved to Canada and reunited with her mother and sisters. But when they arrived, they had to stay in a homeless shelter for a year. When Ubah was 17, a photographer discovered her in a park, and she signed with Click Model Management in New York City. She became well-known in the fashion industry and appeared in Vogue Italia twice. She worked with famous designers and brands like Ralph Lauren, Gucci, and Macy's. Currently, she's still signed to Richard's International Model Management in Vancouver. In 2015, a documentary about Ubah called 'Ubah!' was released. It was directed by Joe Berlinger and talked about Ubah's life in Somalia, her modeling career, and her charitable work in Cambodia.</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>Ubah Hassan is also a hot sauce business owner</h2><p>Ubah Hot is an exciting African-inspired vegan hot sauce brand founded by Ubah Hassan, who also serves as the CEO.

It had the honor of featuring in the seventh episode of the first season of the popular Netflix reality series 'My Unorthodox Life'.

Made with habanero peppers, this hot sauce boasts a rare and special taste, reminding one to see the goodness in everyone. Last but not least, there's Emerald, an exquisite hot sauce featuring serrano peppers, cilantro, and garlic.

Each hot sauce jar comes adorned with a unique color label that corresponds to its title. Additionally, the labels showcase a charming sketch of Ubah Hassan in a captivating modeling pose, adding a touch of elegance to our product presentation.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>'The Real Housewives of New York City', airs every Sunday at 10 pm ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqpiku7p50p6YrKeeYn51edahpmaho2LCo63HZp%2Baq6OWu26x12apmqSgnXqtrdSrnKdlnaSxpriMoqpmmZyherSx02arqGWjpbaksYytn6Kml6h6tryMn6arZaSdsm6uxK2rnqo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
