As of 2023, Grande’s net worth is $240 million. She accumulated her net worth through music releases, acting roles, social media, merchandise sales, and sales of tickets for her live concerts and tours.</p><p>Grande is a widely admired celebrity in the United States and the world. She is known for her pop and R&B songs that are also infused with elements of EDM, trap, and hip hop. Her remarkable ability to sing in the four-octave vocal range puts her beside the likes of world-renowned singers like Prince, Mariah Carey, and the “King of Pop” Michael Jackson.</p><p>Her career started in 2008 with Broadway’s “13: The Musical”, in which she played the role of Charlotte. She was 15 years old back then. In 2010, she starred in the Nickelodeon series Victorious, where she played the role of Cat Valentine. She continued playing that role in the next three seasons (2011-2013) of the show and on another show, “Sam & Cat” (2013). These roles gave her a big break, and she soon started getting recognized.</p><p>Having a passion for music from an early age, Grande used to record covers of many popular songs by artists such as Adele and Whitney Houston during the filming of “Victorious”. One of these covers was discovered on YouTube and sent to the CEO of Republic Records. This eventually led to the 2011 contract between Grande and Republic Records. Grande released her debut album “Yours Truly” under the Republic label in August 2013. The album went on to be a chartbuster and thus propelled Grande’s career towards success.</p><p>Over the years, Grande released several more albums that further pushed her up the lists of the most popular music artists of all time. Her subsequent albums “My Everything” (2014), “Sweetener” (2018), “Thank U”, “Next” (2019), and “Positions” (2020) also topped the Billboard Hot 200 list, while “Dangerous Woman” (2016) made it to the second position.</p><p>Grande is among the most successful singers of all time and is hailed by many as one of the greatest. Having sold over 90 million records worldwide, she is also one of the best-selling music artists. Her success as a pop star is evident from the fact that as of 2022, at age 29, she already has over 207 awards to her name, and the number is only expected to increase in the following years.</p><p>In her fifteen-year career (2008-2022), Grande has been an actress, singer, songwriter, dubbing artist, philanthropist, and an advocate of animal rights, human rights, and social equality.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ariana_Grande_WikiBiography></span><span id=Ariana_Grande_WikiBiography>Ariana Grande Wiki/Biography</span> <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Born on 26 June 1993, Ariana Grande’s age is 29 years as of 2023.
