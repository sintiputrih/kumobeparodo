Her sudden loss has left us hurting and heartbroken, yet we are grateful for this opportunity to share with others how much she meant to us.<br>Diva was an important part of our devoted family. She was born in Ogden, Utah on August 6th, 2009. Her loss will be felt by all including her mother, Cami Aparicio; her father, Isaac Moncada; siblings, Dezmin, Damian, Lexin, D’angelo, Davina, Isaac, Yoshi, Yamauri, and Indie. She was cherished by her grandmothers, Jody Olsen and Josephine Montoya; her grandfather, Fred Moncada; and by so very many aunties, uncles, great grandparents, and cousins.<br>Diva was such a bright light in our lives. She was beautiful and full of life. Those who love her most describe her as spunky, bold, kind, caring, smart, loving, and funny. She made everyone laugh just by being herself. She always supported others in their decisions even if she didn’t agree with them. If someone was in an argument, she would not pick sides or choose favorites, she would just love. Even if those around her were upset, she was happy and smiling. She was quick to include others and she noticed those around her who needed a friend. She made the world a better place.<br>Her brothers when asked what made Diva the most happy at home, her mother Cami. She was the one who held her heart. They as a family loved to go on so many adventures. We are grateful for these fun trips, particularly now as her siblings have special memories of happy times full of laughter, singing and fun with their sister. Diva’s favorite place was on the beach in California. She loved to search for seashells and sand dollars in the ocean. She would spend hours searching for just the right special ones! Her love for the ocean was almost as much as her love for music. If any of her favorite songs ever came on, she had to listen to them at full volume singing and dancing her heart out to every single word.<br>She loved making TikTok dances and was the best at making edits, not only for herself but for others as well, but she was famous for sneaking a video while you weren’t watching and then showing you your goofy new video-giggling uncontrollably over the funny face filters. She absolutely loved playing games with her family. She had a special bond with each of her siblings, but she and her sister Dove were stuck like glue. In their room they have selfies and beautiful twinkling lights strung over an entire wall, a typical little girls room with celebrity crushes pasted by their snapshots. She was full of life and beauty and most of all full of sass! Her brothers say she got the nickname Diva for a reason! She was assertive when she wanted something. And knew how to use those beautiful brown eyes to get her way! She was no sissy and could hold her own. If the boys wanted to get tough, she loved to get tough back and wrestle with the boys, giggling hysterically but she would say “snatch yo weave” and grab a handful of hair if she was losing. She loved to tease others with her sparkly eyes and a mischievous grin.<br>When playing Uno, you had to watch your cards as she’d sneakily swap your hand for hers. She’d wait to see if you noticed, but you’d never know it was her as she had a really good poker face. Even if you caught her, you couldn’t get mad at that beautiful smile. She loved her dogs, and we know that her best buddy Jefe was so excited to greet her in heaven. We are sure our other angels lovingly gathered her in their arms, and we are grateful for our knowledge of life beyond the grave.<br>Diva had a zest for life, and she put her energy into being silly, happy, and lovingly teasing others. As her family, we hope to affectionately continue her legacy by befriending those who need a friend, offering unfailing support to those around us, and finding times to make others laugh. As we mourn her, we hope to also remember and to celebrate her in the days to come by living her example, and we invite you to do the same.<br>Funeral Services will be held Wednesday, January 19th at 11:00 am at Myers Mortuary, 845 Washington Blvd, Ogden, UT. Visitation will be open on Tuesday, January 18th from 6-8 pm. and on Wednesday prior to services from 9:30-10:30 am. She will be interred in the Ogden City Cemetery.<br>In lieu of flowers, those who wish to contribute to this family may participate by donating on Divinaty’s obituary page located on Myers Mortuary’s website www.myers-mortuary.com<br>To send flowers to Divinaty’s family, please visit our floral store.</p><p>Published by Myers Mortuary on Jan. 16, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue86boK2tkafGcLDIr6CnmaSueq6t0aKcZqWfo7CisMBmppuhpKqus8WMa2dpcV1nfXN%2BjKienZ2eYsK1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
