Before they take off, a flight attendant hands her a present—Dibs ice cream snacks—which Davidson sent over to surprise her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"These are my favorite," she told her friends. "We went to the movies in Staten Island, and all I wanted was Dibs. I'm obsessed with Dibs. You can only get them in, like, gas stations these days."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When a friend calls the gesture "sweet," Kardashian jokes, "Is it sweet, or is it, like, being a dick because I have a swimsuit shoot? I shouldn't have eaten that. Thanks, asshole."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later on, in confessional, Kardashian recalls another time Davidson got her ice cream and, apparently, stole her heart.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Pete is such a good, good person. I can't even explain it. He just has the best heart and always thinks of the small things," she says. "One time, Pete was like, 'Babe, let's go get some ice cream at Thrifty.' And I was like, 'Oh, my god, you are making me so fucking horny.' Rite-Aid? Thrifty? It was literally one of the best nights of my life."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39454627/pete-davidson-kim-kardashian-tattoos-branded-relationship/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The couple has gotten more serious" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The couple has gotten more serious</a> since the episode was filmed, and they even <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39828655/kim-kardashian-pete-davidson-marilyn-monroe-dress-met-gala-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="made their Met Gala debut" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">made their Met Gala debut</a> this year, with Davidson looking cool in a suit and sunglasses next to Kardashian, who <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39928683/kim-kardashian-two-marilyn-monroe-dresses-met-gala-2022/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wore Marilyn Monroe" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">wore Marilyn Monroe</a>'s "Happy Birthday Mr. President" dress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Pete and I have been dating for a few months. We're doing really, really good," Kardashian says in a confessional. "Pete said, 'I'm gonna grow on you. Just wait.' He knew. He's like, 'I give it four months in and you're gonna be obsessed.' And I was like, 'Okay. We'll see.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When a show producer asks Kardashian if she's in love with Davidson, the star replies with a smile, "Um, I don't know if that's any of your business."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kardashian is still figuring out what her co-parenting relationship with ex-husband Kanye West looks like following their split, and while <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39572365/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-reunite-son-saint-soccer-game-photos/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the two seem to be getting along" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">the two seem to be getting along</a>, there was a point in time when West went after Davidson on social media, voicing his disapproval of him.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Speaking with her friends on the show, Kardashian says she wants a "drama-free life" and relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"There's always headlines and this and this and this. Even if there's things that are inaccurate, it's not like I could get out there and be like, 'Hey, this is wrong. This is wrong. This is wrong. This is what happened,'" Kardashian says. "At the end of the day, that'll just be another story, another thing. I just want it to go away."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also admits she has tried to keep her romance with Davidson as private as possible because she wants to protect it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I never want the person that I'm dating to be subjected to public scrutiny just because we're dating. He knows what he's getting himself into, obviously, but I'm trying to minimize any tabloid drama," she says in a confessional.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
