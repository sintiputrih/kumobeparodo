She said that her mother was the head of Donnelly’s household, while her father used to stay at home. This made her family something unique.</p><p>proceeds to demonstrate that she was raised in a household headed by a matriarch. That is rather energizing to hear.

She returned to the role in Zombies 2, the movie’s sequel, after almost a year. She currently sits comfortably with a $1.5 million net worth.</p><p>Donnelly intends to pursue her dream of becoming a singer, therefore she has no intention of limiting herself to acting.
