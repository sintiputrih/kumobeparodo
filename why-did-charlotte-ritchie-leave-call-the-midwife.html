When it comes to Charlotte, it appears that her choice to leave the PBS hit show came down to the latter.</p><p>In a 2019 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RadioTimes</a>, Charlotte explained that leaving the series came down to her character maturing and finding happiness, which seemed like the perfect time to go.</p><p>"I felt like Barbara had gone through such a lovely journey, having arrived at Nonnatus House a sort of wreck and quite incompetent, or at least on the surface," Charlotte told the outlet. "And she's really grown up and become this adult. And it felt like such a lovely time, with her wedding to Tom, having found that happiness and reconciled with Trixie. It could be a good time to go."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Charlotte further explained that wanting to spread her wings after four years on the show played a factor in her decision.</p><p>“It seemed like a good time to go," Charlotte told the outlet. "They ask you to commit quite early on in the year to the show. And I always wanted to do it, but I also felt that I'd done three different series for the last five years, and thought it might be good to slightly try and branch out and try something new.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: PBS</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Barbara Hereward left the show after suffering meningitis due to blood poisoning, which led to her death.</h2><p>Since Charlotte made the decision to leave the show, the writers had to get creative with her sendoff.
