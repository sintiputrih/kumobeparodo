Of one thing there is no doubt, however.&nbsp;</p><h2>Her Acting Career</h2><p id=e1YDNlFcZm data-wc=56>She has emerged as one of the UK's most important screen talents. In 2005 , for which she picked up a best actress Golden Globe, took her from popular actress to bona-fide star. Her varied career has also encompassed much lighter fare, such as the crime caper and the action flick &nbsp;</p><p id=evQiopB7FLM data-wc=45>And the movie which first brought her to the attention of America's cinema fans was the tongue-in-cheek special effects extravaganza . Rachel was born in London on March 7, 1971, to a noted Hungarian inventor of life-saving medical equipment, and his Austrian-born psychotherapist wife.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-qsmMx9nc4 data-wc=41>After making their home in the British capital, the couple sent their daughter to two of England's most prestigious educational establishments - St Paul's and Benenden boarding school for girls. At first glance it might seem like a typical privileged childhood.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXhILAcyL0 data-wc=55>But Rachel's youth was not all plain sailing, and she was expelled from Benenden around the time her parents' marriage broke up. As she embarked upon her English degree, modelling and acting work started to come her way although she continued to struggle with emotional difficulties. "My 20s were horrible," she admitted in one interview.&nbsp;</p><p id=epiI1JtSYI data-wc=25>"It was a very trying and difficult time." The 5ft 7in star say her 30s have "calmed me down", and she's much happier these days.&nbsp;</p><h2>Her Personal Life</h2><p id=e9wzkHTGhz data-wc=27>Part of the reason for her newfound contentment is her relationship with indie filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, with whom she has a son, Henry, born in June 2006.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1SczbOLxz data-wc=30>"I found myself a sophisticated, educated American," she says of the man behind critically acclaimed movies and . "He's not an actor. He's travelled the world.&nbsp;</p><p id=esK-dhSkENo data-wc=18>"He knows where Europe is, unlike a lot of Americans, and he's very cultured, but he's all man."&nbsp;</p><p id=eGehYU9Z7v data-wc=32>The couple nonetheless went their separate ways in November 2010. Rachel later found love with James Bond actor <a class=hm-link href=#>Daniel Craig</a>. The duo wed in 2011 just six months after they started dating.&nbsp;</p><p id=eYGkRbpXHUc data-wc=24>According to magazine, Daniel and Rachel said "I do" in front of four people: Daniel's daughter Ella, Rachel's son Henry and two friends.</p><p id=eVr-EVlxzHw data-wc=32>The couple are also doting parents to a daughter whom they keep firmly out of the spotlight. There are no public photos of their shared child whose name also remains a mystery.<br></p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9wcF%2BnrqS0xKVksJ2ZqMdw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
