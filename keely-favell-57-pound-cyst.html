But that “tummy” eventually grew into a mass the size of seven newborn babies.</p><p>After multiple negative pregnancy tests, Favell assumed she was “just fat.” “It crept up so slowly that I didn’t know anything was wrong – I just thought I was putting on timber,” she said.</p><p>But in 2016, Favell blacked out at work and suspected that something might actually be wrong. A general practitioner assured Favell and her partner of 10 years, Jamie Gibbins, that Favell was indeed just pregnant.</p><p>“Looking at me, anyone would have assumed I was nine months pregnant, so naturally they referred me to my local hospital for a pregnancy ultrasound,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a>.</p><p>But an ultrasound in January of last year again proved otherwise.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-199562 alt="Keely Favell After Her Operation" width=624 height=351 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/favell-postop.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-199562 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Keely Favell/Hook News</span><span class=caption-body>Keely Favell, pictured in the hospital.</span></p><p>“I was lying there with Jamie beside me as the radiologist moved the probe over my tummy. I saw her eyes widen in horror, but the screen was just blank. The look on her face said it all – something was wrong, and when she said she had to get a consultant I started to panic. Jamie did his best to reassure me but I felt paralyzed with fear.”</p><p>By this time, it was not unusual for Favell to experience shortness of breath and difficulty walking.</p><p>Keely Favell was consequently rushed to the ER where a CT scan revealed a 57-pound cyst in her ovary. Surgery then yielded a fluid-filled sack the weight of a seven or eight-year-old child.</p><p>The surgeon showed Favell a picture of her mass following the procedure to remove it which shocked the young couple. “It looked like a massive pile of ice cream so I called it Mr. Whippy.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-199564 alt="Keeley Favell After Her Surgery" width=624 height=351 data-sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/keeley-favell-after.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-199564 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Keely Favell/Hook News</span><span class=caption-body>Keely Favell following her surgery.</span></p><p>Despite a scar, stretch marks, and having lost one-third of her body weight, Favell has since gotten her life back and remains able to have children: “I lost sight of how difficult even simple things like driving a car or walking up the stairs had become. Losing my lump gave me my life back – I can’t thank my surgeon enough.”</p><p>After learning about Keely Favell and her 57-pound cyst, check out this <a href=#>132-pound tumor</a> removed from a woman’s abdomen.
