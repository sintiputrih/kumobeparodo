(He previously released new music in 2019 with Hollywood’s Bleeding.)</p><p>Ahead of his baby news, the New York native has been expanding his horizons over the past few years, adding “sommelier” to his resume in 2020. Malone <a href=#>launched a French rosé called Maison No. 9</a> that summer and his website crashed in June 2020 due to the massive amounts of traffic for his pre-sale. Approximately 50,000 bottles were sold in just two days, according to Complex. Malone was able to restock his inventory and last month he teased the <a href=#>return of rosé season</a> via Maison No. 9’s social media page.</p><p>In December 2020, he <a href=#>collaborated with Crocs on his fifth shoe</a>, the Duet Max Clog. While the clogs quickly sold out, Malone announced in January 2021 that he would be partnering with the Musicians on Call charity to donate 10,000 pairs of Crocs to frontline healthcare workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The “One Right Now” rapper <a href=#>previously dated <strong>Ashlen Diaz</strong></a> for three years before he began dating his current girlfriend. Us Weekly exclusively confirmed in November 2018 that Malone and Diaz had called it quits.</p><p>“Post loves Ashlen and cares about her but lives his life as though he’s a rock star. He’s still so young,” an insider told Us at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Two years prior, Malone hinted at the hardships that come with being in a relationship while on the road as a musician.</p><p>“It’s tough having a balance, between <a href=#>dedicating my life to music</a> and dedicating time for Ashlen,” he said on The Breakfast Club in 2016. “It’s tough because you want to get into the studio, you want to do as good music as you can, sometimes you’re real busy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapp6Opeq6ty6ilnmWVrb2mr9OipaBlYajBbq%2FHoqOdZaeewal5zLKqrZ2irnqotdGlnauhlaOxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
