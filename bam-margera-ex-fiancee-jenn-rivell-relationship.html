The show was wild, <a href=#>the stunts were dangerous</a>, and some moments were legitimately <a href=#>funnier than anything on TV</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bam Margera became a household name on the show, and he turned into one of the biggest names on the planet. <a href=#>Things have soured between Margera and his former Jackass mates</a>, but he seems to be doing better these days.</p><p>The married father of one has had a long road, including dealing with an ex that he would rather keep in the past. We have the details below.</p><h2 id=bam-margera-is-a-39-jackass-39-and-skating-legend>Bam Margera Is A 'Jackass' And Skating Legend</h2><p>If you grew up in the 1990s and 2000s, then you are familiar with Bam Margera. He was a key member in the Jackass crew while they were still breaking ground on MTV, and he wound up becoming arguably the most popular member of the legendary Jackass squad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bam's CKY videos are iconic, and they were what helped him get on MTV. Once he started gaining some traction on MTV, he capitalized on his following and established himself as one of the most popular professional skaters on the planet. He was never as good as Tony Hawk, but you had better believe that he sold and unthinkable amount of merch during his prime.</p><p>Eventually, things would peter out in terms of his popularity, but there is no denying the type of impact that he made on the industry. Simply put, he's not as famous as he once was, but everyone still knows and loves him.</p><p>Jackass Forever hit theaters earlier this year, and fans were genuinely disappointed to see that Bam wasn't part of the movie. This has led to many wondering what he has been up to, and the things that he has gone through to get where he is now.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About The Origin Of 'Jackass'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bam-is-currently-married-and-has-a-child>Bam Is Currently Married And Has A Child</h2><p>These days, Bam Margera is married, and he even has a son. He has worked extremely hard to get his life back on track, and he seems dedicated to making things work for his health and his family.</p><p>Bam and his wife, Nicole, tied the knot at a music festival, and in true Bam Margera style, the wedding was anything but casual.</p><p>"The proceeds from the event, which Bam and Nikki opened to anyone who could actually get to Iceland via Facebook, were donated to build a skate park in Reykjavik after another one was demolished. We know, all this charity sounds quite tasteful and grown-up for the Port-O-Potty pusher we've come to know and fear love, but there were still a few vestiges from the old Bam, like the fact that he wore a hoodie, sunglasses and some kind of modified Skeletor costume to his own nuptials. If he sported a tux, we'd really be worried," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV</a> reported.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a wild time, and it kickstarted what has been a lasting marriage for Margera and Nicole, who welcomed their son in 2017.</p><p>Unfortunately, things have not always been smooth for Bam and some of his exes. In fact, he had a pretty turbulent time with someone that he was once engaged to.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Guys Of 'Jackass' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=bam-had-a-rocky-run-with-an-ex>Bam Had A Rocky Run With An Ex</h2><p>Earlier on in his Jackass career, Bam was engaged to a woman named Jenn Rivell, who appeared in his CKY projects. They seemed fine on camera, but behind the scenes, things were not so pretty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>, "In 2006 he took the stand in a Pennsylvania Common Pleas Court to file for a PFA (protection from abuse) order, alleging that Rivell scaled the 10-foot wall of his Pocopson mansion and proceeded to break in through the back door, the second time she had entered his home after their nasty split without his express permission. As Margera put it: 'She hopped over the fence and kicked the door open. ... She yelled at me and said I shouldn't have broken up with her.'"</p><p>This is already tough enough to deal with, but unfortunately, the story doesn't stop there, as Bam would also talk about alleged physical violence that took place in that relationship.</p><p>As Looper noted, Margera "told the court that she pushed him into an empty swimming pool and threw glass at him instead of helping him up."</p><p>This didn't hold up in the long run, but it gave people an idea of what was taking place between the two while they were still together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Are The 'Jackass' Stars Married To?</a></span></p><p>Bam's time with Rivell is ancient history, and fans are hopeful that things stay healthy with his wife.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Bam Margera's Current Relationship With Johnny Knoxville And 'Jackass'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZmqVdoq6zs8SrmGadqGKzqq3NnJyeZZqau6950aKtnqScYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
