And because we could never have predicted [a revival] in the past,” she continued. “So that door is open. Is it creatively warranted? Is it, you know, something? I don’t know. I don’t know. But yes, technically yes.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lauren-Graham-Has-a-Gilmore-Girls-Clause-in-Her-Contracts.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist</a> actress pointed out that shows are “so restrictive now” so adding in the Gilmore Girls stipulation ensures that she can “carve out some pockets [of time] just in case.”</p><p>Graham also spoke about her new series, <a href=#>The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers</a>, which premieres this month on Disney+, joking about how her costar <a href=#><strong>Emilio Estevez</strong></a>’s character <a href=#>Gordon Bombay</a> is somewhat similar to her former love interest Luke Danes (played by <a href=#><strong>Scott Patterson</strong></a>).</p><p>“I seem to find myself in this dynamic of, like, trying to get a very stoic, curmudgeonly Eeyore, to like respond to my antics,” she said of her characters and onscreen boyfriends.</p><p>When Shaw commented on the “slight Luke Danes vibe” coming from Estevez’s Coach Bombay in the hockey series, which he played in three <a href=#>Mighty Ducks</a> films before the TV show revival, Graham admitted it’s not the first time one of her onscreen counterparts resembled the Luke and Lorelai dynamic.</p><p>“You know, I’ve said this before, but when we were doing <a href=#>Parenthood</a> and I had a little bit of that vibe with<a href=#> <strong>Ray Romano</strong></a>, my boyfriend, [<a href=#><strong>Peter Krause</strong></a>], said, ‘It’s, like, you’re a piccolo and he’s the bassoon,’” the Talking as Fast as I Can author recalled. “And it’s just, like, a great duet, you know. You don’t want two piccolos or two bassoons. I’ve found my new bassoon.”</p><p>Sherman-Palladino, 55, revealed in October 2020 that <a href=#>another Gilmore Girls reboot could happen</a> down the line, but for now it’s on hold based on the actors’ schedules.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[A Year in the Life] was one of those kismet moments where we were kind of all looking at each other and going, ‘Well, let’s take a couple of months and hang out together and remind each other why we drove each other crazy.’ And it was a wonderful experience,” she said during a virtual Woodstock Film Festival panel. “I really do believe that if the time is right and the girls are where they need to be in their lives [it could happen]. They all have things … <a href=#>But if that [kismet] moment presents itself again</a>, [we’d do it] in a hot second.”</p><p>While Lorelai isn’t returning to TV just yet, Graham can be seen in The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers when it premieres on Disney+ on Friday, March 26.</p><p><strong>For more hot celebrity news, listen to Us Weekly editors dish on top topics & trends with these clips from the Hot Hollywood Podcast!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOaraKau26z0ZqfmqVdna60ecBmnqKknaS%2FpnnGoqmlq12YuaLB0p5koqZdnbKzecKopa2qkZjBtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
