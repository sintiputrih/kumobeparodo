Thus far, the show has featured jokes about everything from Bat-Mite to Batman, and recently, the series <a href=#>even lampooned</a> <strong><a href=#>Superman</a></strong> himself. The joke comes when Peacemaker suggests that the heroic Kryptonian has a “poop fetish.”</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>“He uber-liebes the old scheisse, as I understand it,” <strong><a href=#>John Cena</a></strong>‘s titular character explains.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Although some fans found the joke hilarious, others were not amused, saying that it crossed a line around good taste in the DC universe. Some have even wondered whether DC or Warner Bros. signed off on the joke, given how vulgar and gross it is. According to creator <strong><a href=#>James Gunn</a></strong>, though, everyone was totally fine with it. “Neither DC not [sic] Warner Bros ever brought it up,” he explained on Twitter in response to a question about the joke.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1487611282849161216?</figure><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>During the watch party for episode 5, Gunn also said “I don’t think Superman really has a poop fetish for the record.” Gunn has previously discussed how little supervision he received on Peacemaker, saying that the studio essentially gave him <a href=#>free rein </a>over the project. In the past, Warner Bros. was even interested in bringing Gunn in to direct a Superman project.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>“First they came to me and said ‘Superman, Superman, Superman,’ and I said ‘I don’t know.’ Then they said ‘what about&nbsp;Suicide Squad,’ and I said ‘no,'” Gunn said during an interview with <a href=#>Newsweek</a> over the summer of 2021. Of course, Gunn eventually wound up directing The Suicide Squad, a sort sequel/reboot to David Ayer’s 2016 movie Suicide Squad.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>Originally, one of Gunn’s ideas for The Suicide Squad was that the team would have to go up against Superman near the end of the film. “The Suicide Squad has to catch Superman for some reason,” Gunn said of his premise during an interview with <a href=#>Filmstarts</a>. “That was all just a vague idea. It’s gotten out of hand or is being controlled by someone. And then this group of lousy super-villains has to face the most powerful hero in the world.”</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>That idea never came to be, but The Suicide Squad did lead to Peacemaker, which now features the occasional poop fetish joke about the Kryptonian wonder, so it wasn’t a total loss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrrcyeqmafpaO7brzEmpqepZGgsrN50q6nnqqdlrtuts6knGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
