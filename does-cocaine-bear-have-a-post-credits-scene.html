The new film was directed by Elizabeth Banks, released on Feb. 24, 2023, and stars Keri Russell, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich, Ray Liotta, and celebrated character actor Margo Martindale. Cocaine Bear is exactly what it sounds like, as it follows a bear who ingests a tremendous amount of cocaine.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>After a drug smuggler throws his duffel bags of cocaine outside of his plane, a black bear manages to get addicted to the drug, driving him wild. The bear wrecks havoc in a forest, killing many as it hunts down more cocaine. The movie follows the drug dealers who are trying to retrieve the cocaine in question, while a mother tries to save her daughter from the rampaging bear after she skipped school to go to the forest. You can read our review of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cocaine Bear here</a>.</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>Eventually, the bear successfully marks its territory, with everyone either fleeing the park or in pieces. You might be wondering if it’s worth sitting through the credits for any more bear shenanigans, so let’s take a look at the end of the movie and tell you if it’s worth waiting around.</p><h2 id=h-is-there-anything-after-the-credits-of-cocaine-bear data-injectable=false>Is there anything after the credits of Cocaine Bear?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cocaine-bear-rotten-tomatoes.png><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>You might be surprised to learn that there is a post-credits scene in Cocaine Bear; in fact, there are two. They aren’t too far into the credits either, beginning after the first few credits roll. The first scene features a character we haven’t talked about yet, Stache (Aaron Holliday). Stache is a member of The Duchamps Gang, a gang that was terrorizing visitors to the forest before the bear went ape.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that he made it out of the park before the bear got to him, after being held at gunpoint by Daveed (Jackson Jr.) and Eddie (Ehrenreich). He did not escape empty-handed either, as it is revealed that he is hitchhiking to New York with one of the bags of cocaine. He’s probably going to be living very large if he manages to offload the cocaine without being caught. Unless it’s setting up a sequel called Cocaine Rats.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cocaine-bear-2.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>The next post-credits scene sees Daveed and Eddie, now accompanied by Bob’s (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) dog Rosette, make it home to Eddie’s son Gabe. Earlier in the film, Bob shot off Daveed’s fingers and they were being kept in Eddie’s pocket. Unfortunately, the Cocaine Bear is not the only animal in the movie that has a taste for human flesh, as Rosette sees Daveed’s fingers as a doggy treat, and has a good feed.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Those are both of the post-credits scenes in Cocaine Bear. Although you could always support the people who made the film by sticking around and watching the credits. You might also want to see if any animals were harmed in the making of this film, although it’s more likely that the CGI bear hurt more humans than the other way around. If you do make it to the very end of the movie, you will hear one final roar from the Cocaine Bear herself.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=72 data-injectable=false>You can catch Cocaine Bear in all its glory while it is in theaters now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2KwsK%2FAoqWeZZKarrN5x5qtnmWRYr2wv9NmmqudlJ7BtHnSnJynnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
