Well, if you’re Florida man Rocky Money Rudolph Jr., the answer is speeding off — with the deputy in question hanging off the hood of your car.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to CBS News</a>, Rudolph sped off with the sheriff’s deputy dangling from his hood for nearly 100 yards before he stopped.</p><p>It all began when Deputy Aaron Blais stopped Rudolph one Saturday morning for having illegal window tints on his Cadillac Escalade.</p><p>The two initially spoke cordially, with Blais aptly telling Rudolph he has “the best name I’ve seen” in 14 years of police work.</p><p>Unfortunately, things went south when Blais smelled marijuana, which Rudolph denied having on his person or in his vehicle. When Blais asked him to turn the engine off, Rudolph put his seatbelt on and took off.</p><p>“Put your hands up! Put your fucking hands up!” Blais yelled pointing his gun at the driver and holding onto the car for dear life.</p><p>In a remarkably bold move, Rudolph grabbed the deputy’s pistol and took off a second time. Blais held on as long as he could but eventually fell onto the road.</p><p>He did fire several shots during this bizarre encounter, with one bullet hitting Rudolph in the leg.</p><p>It was later discovered Rudolph was a convicted felon and was captured following a seven-hour manhunt.</p><p>Rudolph was consequently charged with attempted murder.</p><p>The incident, captured on both the deputy’s body and dashcams, was posted to Facebook by the Seminole County Sheriff’s office in “the spirit of transparency.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynuM6roJ2ZXaKur3nHnpidpJmjsrR5kWlocmdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
