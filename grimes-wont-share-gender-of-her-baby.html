I don't think they can consent to being famous or being in public," said the singer. "And I don't want to gender them in case that's not how they feel in their life. I don't know, I just feel like it doesn't need to be known."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The singer confirmed her statement again when a fan on Twitter asked if she's having "a girl or boy." She responded, "They may decide their fate and identity." (The tweet has since been deleted.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Grimes—who just released her new album, Miss Anthropocene—also shared that she does have a name picked out, but she has no plans on sharing that either.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have a name for the baby, but I don't want to say what it is because everyone I've told it hates it, and everyone's gonna make fun of it," explained Grimes. "But it is, in fact, a genius name and people just don't appreciate it yet because it's too avant-garde."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
