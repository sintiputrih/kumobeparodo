He began making music in the fifth grade, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>UpRoxx</a>, when he started using his first cellphone as a microphone until his mother bought him one in 10th grade.</p><h2 data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>A snowstorm caused a nightlong recording session that kick started his career</h2><p id=content-paragraph-2>In 2012, Armani made his way to a recording studio with $150 to work for a few hours on music, per UpRoxx. When a powerful snowstorm hit, stranding the studio’s employees inside, Armani and sound engineer <strong>Don Groove</strong> ended up working the night away, eventually laying down the track “Billie Eilish.”</p><h2>Armani’s Dad Made Sure He Never Had His Bike Stolen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-things-armani-white-embed2.jpg>Armani’s dad bought him a bike when he was a kid and made sure to instill some pride in the purchase. “The way I grew up, my dad was like, ‘I don’t care what went on outside, you are not coming in this house without your bike,’” Armani explained, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>UpRoxx</a>. “Philly&nbsp;has a very stark way of deciding if you’re going to be prey or the predator. I’ll tell you one thing: no matter how the fight went, I left with that bike.”<h2>His Favorite Christmas Tradition Is Making Sugar Cookies</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Speaking at the Mercedes-Benz Interview Lounge during <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Z100’s Jingle Ball</a> concert this year, Armani said his favorite part of the holidays is baking with his mom. “Me and my mom will usually get together and make sugar cookies,” he explained. “And I get her this really big Christmas tree — it never fits in the house. But I get her this really big Christmas tree, we make sugar cookies and I just wear long johns. …I love my mom.”</p><h2>Armani Gifted His Mom A Bucket Of $100,000</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Armani shared a clip of himself giving his mom a bucket of cash to celebrate his newfound success in the music industry…and it might make you cry (above). “Seeing you this happy was worth way more than the record deal,” he wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. “You saved my life before i could even understand what you were doing. Everything they love about me I learned from you. You bought me my first microphone in 10th grade. It was a $100, I was begging you for it, like just trust me lol. And you did just that. $100,000 isn’t even half your worth… just all I can afford right now 😂💙 Happy birthday mom, I love you so much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2Kus7nAp6Bmr5iewaZ5k3JucG9oaHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
