In the movie, the God of Thunder comes out of retirement to fight Gorr the God Butcher, a new and dangerous threat. Gorr kills Gods and wants them to die out, as his name suggests. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must work with his friends, including King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and his ex-lover Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), to defeat the evil.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-37707 alt="Thor Love and Thunder" width=700 height=368 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Thor-Love-and-Thunder-700x368.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-37707 class=wp-caption-text>Thor Love and Thunder</p><p>The movie directed by Taika Waititi is getting a lot of attention on social media, and people have a lot of different opinions about how it turned out. Even though critics and moviegoers have mixed feelings about the movie, there is one thing that everyone agrees is great: Christian Bale’s scary performance as Gorr the God Butcher.</p><p>With “Thor: Love and Thunder,” the actor went back to the superhero world, but this time he played a bad guy. In Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” trilogy, Bale played Batman and got a lot of praise for it. But it seems that by playing a bad guy in the MCU, the actor has topped himself. Fans can’t stop raving about the star and say that he is the best part of the movie.</p><p>One fan wrote, “#ChristianBale’s acting as #Gorr is fu**in’ amazing.” Everyone thinks what he does is right because of him. Every time he shows up, he takes the show by storm. Everything about him is great, from the way he looks to the way he laughs. He is one of the most dangerous bad guys in the #MCU.” Another person on social media said, “#ChristianBale as #Gorr was evil, scary, and threatening—everything a villain should be.” “The only good thing about #ThorLoveandThunder is #ChristianBale,” wrote another Christian Bale fan on Twitter. The man didn’t stop working for even a second. And, thank goodness, wasn’t made fun of like the other characters.”</p><p>One of the fans, on the other hand, said that Bale didn’t deserve a bad script. The user wrote, “No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!” Christian Bale should have had more screen time, a better role, a better script, and an overall better Marvel Cinematic Universe debut!! “I’ll remember how he played Gorr, but I’m not sure I’ll remember the movie,” another fan tweeted.</p><p>“Honestly, #ChristianBale felt too good for #ThorLoveandThunder,” said another fan. His acting and character didn’t fit with the rest of the story.</p><p>This is the first time Bale has played a bad guy in a superhero movie. This is his fourth superhero movie. Everyone thought that the Oscar-winning actor Christian Bale would give a god-like performance, and it looks like he did just that. But people haven’t been that excited about the movie. Fans and critics have said that the movie is a letdown after “Ragnarok,” which was called one of the best Marvel movies ever.</p><p>Disclaimer: This article has quotes from people and organizations that were made on the Internet.
