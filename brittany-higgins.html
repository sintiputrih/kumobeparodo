She bravely decided to come forward last year with claims that a coworker had sexually assaulted her within Parliament House, starting a life-altering, ground-breaking journey that has seen her become the force of change.</p><p>The former Liberal staffer’s courageous actions not only played a crucial role in 2021’s reckoning for women but also inspired Jenkins to bring the Set of the Standard review to Parliament House, which is a fantastic accomplishment for the young lady.</p><p>While talking to Marie Claire, Brit made shocking revelations. In one of her statements, she said, “I remember the blank looks from my superiors in parliament trying to offer me solace by saying, ‘It’s just the way things are.”</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Brittany Higgins going for court hearing" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brittany-Higgins-going-for-court-hearing.jpeg alt="Brittany Higgins going for court hearing" width=400 height=365 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Case Terminated By Canberra Court</strong></h2><p>A Canberra courtroom experienced genuine drama on October 26, 2022. The Federal Police have been notified of comments made by Brittany Higgins shortly after the rape trial of Bruce Lerrimon was terminated due to a rogue juror.</p><p>Before the jury could decide whether Miss Higgins was raped inside Parliament House, the judge was compelled to prematurely terminate the trial due to the accidental discovery of a prohibited document in the jury room. The victim woman was sobbing and shaking when she spoke; some of her remarks may have had a significant legal impact.</p><p>According to 7News Australia, Chief Justice McCallum cautioned the jurors 17 times throughout the trial to avoid doing their own research. However, the juror won’t be punished because of ACT law.</p><p>Bruce Lehrriman asserts his innocence. After Ms. Higgins spoke outside of court, his legal team released this statement. Bruce’s attorney has made the court and the Australian Federal Police aware of the remarks given by the alleged victim.</p><p>Lehrman is prohibited from contacting Ms. Higgins, her family, or her partner David Sharaz by the terms of his bail. He must disclose to the Australian Federal Police where he resides and if he intends to travel abroad, his travel plans. A retrial has been set to start on February 20, 2023.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Brittany Higgins father" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Brittany-Higgins-father.jpg alt="Brittany Higgins father" width=400 height=436 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>How old is Brittany Higgins?</strong></h2><p>On <strong>December 7, 1994, Brittany Higgins (age 28)</strong> took birth in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.
