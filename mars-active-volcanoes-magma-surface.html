volcanism on the Red Planet occurred between three and four billion years ago, with smaller eruptions continuing up to three million years ago.</p><p>But, until now, there was no evidence to indicate Mars could still be volcanically active.</p><p>Researchers at the University of Arizona and the Planetary Science Institute scanned the surface of Mars using data from orbiting satellites.</p><p>Specifically, they analysed images of the relatively featureless equatorial plains of a region known as Elysium Planitia.</p><img

a previously unknown pile of ancient ash and rock known as a volcanic deposit that's up to 50,000 years old.</p><p>If their calculations are correct, it would mean that volcanic eruptions were occurring on Mars more recently than we thought.</p><p>"This may be the youngest volcanic deposit yet documented on Mars," said study lead author Dr David Horvath.</p><p>"If we were to compress Mars' geologic history into a single day, this would have occurred in the very last second."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000649181757.jpg><p>Scientists believe the eruption was caused by gases in&nbsp;the Martian magma, or when the magma&nbsp;came into contact&nbsp;with permafrost at the surface.</p><p>The resulting explosion produced an 8-mile-wide, smooth, dark deposit surrounding a 20-mile-long volcanic fissure.</p><p>Ash and rock would have been flung up to six miles into the Martian atmosphere, according to the researchers.</p><p>Having occurred so recently, the find hints that magma may still flow under the surface of Mars today.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Mars facts</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center

Planet...</p><ul><li>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun</li><li>It is named after the Roman god of war</li><li>The landmass of Mars is very similar to Earth but due to the difference in gravity you could jump three times higher there than you can here</li><li>Mars is mountainous and hosts the tallest mountain known in the Solar System called Olympus Mons, which is three times higher than Everest</li><li>Mars is considered to be the second most habitable planet after Earth</li><li>It takes the planet 687 Earth days to orbit the Sun</li><li>So far, there has been 39 missions to Mars but only 16 of these have been successful</li></ul><p>"The young age of this deposit absolutely raises the possibility that there could still be volcanic activity on Mars," Dr Horvath said.</p><p>The discovery also suggests that conditions below the surface of the distant world may have been habitable in its recent history.</p><p>That's because magma rising from beneath may have melted ice at the planet's surface, creating a favourable environment for microbial life.</p><p>"This does not necessarily confirm past life on Mars, but does imply an environment conducive to habitability," Dr Horvath
