So you see he is actually a “YoungBoy”.</span></p><p><span>He is an American citizen but of African American heritage.&nbsp;His childhood was not really idle since his mother did not do much to raise him.&nbsp;Also, his father was barely in the photo – the man was behind bars serving a 55-year sentence.&nbsp;The law caught up with him when Youngboy was only 8 years old.&nbsp;Thus, the rapper was raised by his maternal grandmother until his death from heart failure.</span></p><p><span>It is said that this guy got his musical talent from his mother who was once a rapper.&nbsp;Youngboy started writing songs and singing when he was much younger.&nbsp;He left high school in the 9th grade to devote himself to music and soon began producing music at the age of 14.&nbsp;In 2014 he released his first mixtape “Life Before Fame”.&nbsp;“Mind of a Menace” mixtapes 1, 2, and 3 lag behind.&nbsp;The following year, NBA Youngboy had a falling out with fellow rapper Scotty Cain.&nbsp;In December of the same year, he decided to put his anger into words.&nbsp;He released a rap beef song which drew reaction from another song by his rival.&nbsp;As expected, this rap battle garnered so much attention and interestingly became the NBA’s first celebrity date.</span></p><p><span>His music career started to take shape, but then he got a run-in with the law in November 2016 and had to be jailed for a while.&nbsp;While that slowed him down, nothing could stop him.&nbsp;He released three more songs while there;&nbsp;“Win or lose”, “It doesn’t matter” and “Too much”.&nbsp;A week after his departure, he released another “Untouchable”.&nbsp;Youngboy dropped his debut album “Untill Death Call My Name” on April 27, 2018.</span></p><p><span>NBA Youngboy has had several nasty incidents with the law, he seems to have a thing for breaking the rules.&nbsp;Right after leaving school to pursue his career in music, he was arrested and sent to a juvenile detention center for theft.</span></p><p><span>You’d think he learned his lesson after this purchase, you’d be surprised.&nbsp;In November 2016, Youngboy was arrested and charged with two counts of attempted first degree murder.&nbsp;Apparently he was involved in a drive-by shooting.&nbsp;This time he received a 10-year suspended prison sentence and three years of active probation – that is, in August 2017. In February 2018, he was arrested again for assault, weapons violations and kidnappings.&nbsp;From what we’ve calculated, he was jailed but released on $75,000 bail in March 2018. The case is still pending around his neck.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>The NBA isn’t incredibly rich, but he boasts a net worth of over $1 million.&nbsp;He pulled off a lot in a short time through his songs and YouTube channels.&nbsp;At this rate, Youngboy will probably never be broke again.&nbsp;In fact, he once bragged about not wearing the same suit twice.&nbsp;It is said that he would throw them at fans while performing.&nbsp;Reportedly, the five-album deal signed in October 2016 with Atlantic was worth $2 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Children and girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>The rapper is currently dating Instagram star Jania Jackson.&nbsp;They started in December 2017. The two are no strangers to social media drama.&nbsp;There have been rumors that he cheats and is violent with Jania.&nbsp;His ex-girlfriends, Mallu Trevejo and Danielle Bregoli, reportedly fought publicly because of him.&nbsp;He even has four children.&nbsp;Kamiri, Kamron, Kayden and Taylin.&nbsp;All from different baby mothers.&nbsp;Despite everything that happened, they remained inseparable.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height – How tall is it?</span></strong></h2><p><span>As of this writing, the NBA is approximately 8 inches taller than 5 feet.&nbsp;Considering his age, it is very likely that this musician will grow up in the near future.</span></p><p><span>Here is.&nbsp;Everything you need to know about NBA YoungBoy, the good, the bad and the ugly.&nbsp;What can we say?&nbsp;He’s a hell of a guy.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGimkpZ6urvUp56bp6lixKq3yGaZoqddlrSmeceeoKCgpGK7psCMsKarrJhiuKqw0maeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
