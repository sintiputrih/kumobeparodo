Twitter account @filmdaze just tweeted a quartet of molten hot black and white pics featuring the actress <a href=#>topless</a>—and in a couple of shots, nearly bottomless as well! Stewart’s sexy, provocative poses are the very antithesis of timid high schooler Bella Swan.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The pictures are part of a photo shoot the Spencer star did for Elle Japan. The first pic shows Kristen Stewart staring into the distance while chewing seductively on a <a href=#>Chanel</a> necklace. Though the picture is only from the shoulders up, it’s clear that the actress isn’t wearing a top—a prospect hot enough on its own to fog up any computer or smartphone screen. Something about the way the necklace chain pulls down her supple bottom lip, however, makes the picture ten times sexier.</p><p>It’s the second picture, though, where Kristen Stewart has her back to the camera, that’s really tantalizing. Stewart’s back is bare except for her cascading wavy locks and the same Chanel necklace worn backward—as is her lower half. Kristen stands with her hands stuffed inside the only article of clothing she has on—a pair of fishnet tights that fully expose her curvy backside.</p><p>For photo three, Kristen Stewart—her hair now shorter and slightly less wavy, her torso still bare—poses sideways, crouched with one hand strategically covering the part of her breast not suitable for a family publication. The 33-year-old traded in her completely <a href=#>see-through</a> fishnet bottoms for a pair of Chanel sweatpants and chunky heels. A large Chanel bracelet completes the titillating shot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kristen-stewart-smoking-900x556.jpg><p>The fourth and final picture in the tweet is of Kristen Stewart—her hair magically back to its original length—again crouching but this time facing the camera. She’s back to the <a href=#>fishnet</a> tights and nothing else, trusting only a shadow to keep her from pulling a Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. Kristen is again wearing a pair of chunky heels, but anyone looking at the spicy photo would be forgiven for not noticing.</p><p>When Kristen Stewart isn’t busy doing sexy photoshoots for famous magazines, she’s acting. From the actress’s breakout role at 12 years old opposite Jodie Foster in 2002’s Panic Room to her star-making turn in the Twilight franchise, Stewart has been wowing audiences with her intense ability to disappear into any role. An ability she’ll need to really tap into for her <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=upcoming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>upcoming</a> role in the film Love Me.</p><p>Love Me is—according to <a href=#>IMDb</a>—a love story between a satellite and a buoy. The Sci-fi oddity also stars Beef’s Steven Yeun. No word yet on which actor will be the satellite and which one will play the buoy.</p><p>Slightly less weird is the similarly named Love Lie Bleeding, the second project that Kristen Stewart currently has in post-production. A romantic thriller, Bleeding also stars Dave Franco, Jena Malone, and veteran actor Ed Harris. The movie is the second feature film for director Rose Glass and focuses on the competitive world of bodybuilding.</p><p>Both films should see release dates sometime between late 2023 and early 2024. In the meantime, fans of Kristen Stewart can always pick up a copy of Elle Japan and <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=marvel data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>marvel</a> over the gorgeous star’s sensual photos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnm6e2tMDEp2SsrJWsrrPAjK6lm52cnrK3rcGlsGarpaHBs8WNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
