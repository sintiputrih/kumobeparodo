Having never gone to tribal council, things are looking great for the Chicago native thus far, however, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor</a> superfans can’t wait to see his gameplay continue to unfold as the season progresses — after all, there have only been four episodes!</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>As the competition starts to get more and more intense, will Austin play a heroic game like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cirie Fields</a>, or a villainous game like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sandra Diaz-Twine</a>? Only time will tell…</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, in his official biography for Survivor 45, the graduate student revealed which castaways he feels as though he will play the most similar game to.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=814 data-injectable=true>“I identify most with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Owen Knight</a>&nbsp;— long hair, Asian, loves the outdoors, never-say-die attitude. I think I’ll play most like&nbsp;Jay&nbsp;[Starrett] and&nbsp;Wendell [Holland]. Their games revolved around forming genuine connections that led people to keep them in the game, even when they were huge threats. On top of that, I have the intelligence to make big strategic plays as well as the physicality to win clutch immunities,” he explained.</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>Concluding with a grin, “Also, like them both, I too have a crush on&nbsp;Michele [Fitzgerald]” — seriously though, who doesn’t?</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>While Owen, Jay, Wendell, and Michele are the few castaways he mentioned in his official biography for Survivor 45, turns out there is another former Survivor contestant who he has been messaging for years.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>Keep scrolling who was lucky enough to receive a DM (or should we say a series of DMs?) from Austin Li Coon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>To the surprise of Survivor superfans across the globe, Austin revealed in an exclusive interview with Entertainment Weekly that <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin “Coach” Wade</a></strong> of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Survivor: Tocantins</a>,&nbsp;Survivor: Heroes vs Villains, and&nbsp;Survivor: South Pacific is his favorite castaway of all time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>“Coach, easily.
