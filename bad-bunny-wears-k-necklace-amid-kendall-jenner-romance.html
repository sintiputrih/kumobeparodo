He paired the accessory with a brown hoodie, a green T-shirt, black sunglasses and<a href=#> a baseball cap</a>. (The necklace wasn’t the only thing Bad Bunny showed off on Sunday. He also flashed his<a href=#> abs and waistline</a> in a NSFW shower selfie.)</p><p>Earlier this month, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that Jenner “has been <a href=#>getting much closer</a> with Bad Bunny over the past several months.” The insider continued, “Things were more casual when they first started dating, but after a short period of time she saw long-term potential in their relationship.”</p><p>The two gave onlookers a glimpse at their romance on August 13 when they were seen making out at a <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong> </a>concert in Los Angeles. “Kendall had an amazing time with Bad Bunny <a href=#>at the Drake concert</a>, and she feels very close to him,” the same insider told Us at the time. Later at the show, a fan shared a video <a href=#>via TikTok</a> of Bad Bunny whispering something to Jenner that made her laugh so hard she fell to the ground. He helped her back up, and the two hugged while she kissed his cheek.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bad-Bunny-Wears-K-Necklace-Amid-Kendall-Jenner-Romance-2.jpg><p>The duo first sparked relationship rumors in February, after they were seen out and about with Jenner’s BFF <a href=#><strong>Hailey Bieber</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>. The following month, Jenner and Bad Bunny were spotted <a href=#>on another date</a>.</p><p>In May, they were photographed <a href=#>leaving the Met Gala</a> together. For fashion’s biggest night, Jenner rocked a sequined <a href=#>Marc Jacobs bodysuit</a> featuring a bedazzled collar, thong back and sleeves that cascaded to the ground. She teamed<a href=#> the getup</a> with sparkly platform boots and diamond earrings.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bad-Bunny-Wears-K-Necklace-Amid-Kendall-Jenner-Romance-3.jpg><p>For glam, her locks were parted down the middle and slicked back into<a href=#> a ponytail</a>.
