However, many people may not have heard of Joe Metheny, a deranged killer who did more than just horrify everyone in the media and society.</p><p>Metheny was arrested back in December of 1996 in Baltimore. He was convicted of killing three people, but admitted to having killed at least 10 during his reign. Things get worse, though.</p><p>New information about this case recently came up, including the fact that Metheny ended up selling the flesh of his victim’s at the burger stand he used to run. The deranged individual said that no one could tell the difference between the human meat or the pork that he had mixed together. He simply saw the people he killed as meat and nothing more.</p><p>He said: “I killed seven people (he later confessed to three more), three men, and four women. Two men I chopped up with an axe under a bridge in South Baltimore. I was found not guilty for them cause they couldn’t prove I did it. Under that same bridge I also killed two women and one man who was fishing, who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I weighed their bodies down and put them in that river. I showed the police where I put them about 3 years later, but they couldn’t find them. So they could not charge me for them.”</p><p>Police described this as “brutal sexual assaults that seem to suggest a psychotic aggression toward a certain type of woman“. Metheny still shows zero remorse for his actions.</p><p>“Well that’s my story, horrible but true. So the next time you’re riding down the road and you happen to see an open pit beef stand, that you’ve never seen before, make sure you think about this story before you take a bite of that sandwich. Sometimes you never know who you may be eating. Ha! Ha”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvLsKatZpOkunC%2FxKugmqRdoLatuMSrZKOnlWK6psDHnqWyZaOkuaV5x6KqZq6ZmMGqudJmnaWdo516qrqMm6yrn5WnwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
