Dissecting what is or isn’t appropriate can sometimes be a headache, but it doesn’t have to be. Work pants can pretty much be the solution to any “what to wear?” questions you might have. Trousers make sense in every type of environment — whether that be a strict, corporate office or a casual, startup space — and can be more comfortable and effortless than stuffy shift dresses or fitted pencil skirts. The best work pants make getting dressed daily all the easier, rather than another chore on your already extensive to-do list.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, there are a lot of work pants out there, so to get you started, three fashion experts helped us curate a list of the 20 best work pants that will be your new favorite, closet godsends. This extensive guide offers every silhouette imaginable — from wide-leg, straight-leg, skinny, and more — at a range of price points to fit any budget. We looked at a variety of fabrics, too, that work with several climates and seasons and peppered in some styling tips, how-to’s, and more to keep you polished, professional, and confident day after day. Dressing for the office never looked so good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-reformation-mason-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Mason Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Mason Pant " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oJG--R4uwt1hRB1Arr2EW86Dakk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/reformation-mason-pant--59e12193e06e4a0789215d1f00862f71.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The soft, comfortable fabric is great for all-season wear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It doesn’t come in plus sizing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Two of our experts recommended Reformation’s Mason Pant for many reasons. “This pant is a good essential to have in your closet because it’s a core color and a timeless silhouette,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cassandra Sethi</a>, personal stylist and founder of Next Level Wardrobe, tells InStyle. “It’s made of a medium weight fabric (twill), medium rise, and has some subtle pleats for extra comfort.” We love that these trousers are made from Tencel Lyocell, an eco-friendly fabric derived from eucalyptus trees, that is very soft and comfortable to wear.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fashion stylist and content creator <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Audree Kate López</a> also enjoys the timelessness of this style. “The Reformation Mason Pant are classic, relaxed dress pants with a pleated waist,” she says. “These pants are lightweight, can be dressed up or down, and come in black and khaki.” We would pair them with a sleeveless turtleneck, matching blazer, and pumps for a more corporate workplace or an oversized button-down shirt and flats for a casual office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Tencel lyocell<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>0–12<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Length: </strong>32-inch inseam</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-amazon-essentials-skinny-ankle-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon Essentials Skinny Ankle Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Essentials Skinny Ankle Pant " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/63BabvSNopR4R_0lX8h5II-yzk4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-essentials-skinny-ankle-pant-e5b1cecb4955456588f81cd4745c2572.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re machine washable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There is a fit discrepancy between reviewers on whether they run large or small.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If a small budget is on your mind, the Amazon Essentials Skinny Ankle Pant is the answer. These slim-fit, trouser pants are stretchy, comfortable, and affordable. Priced just under $30, they’re pants that you can wear over and over — and even order multiples of without buyer’s remorse. The skinny fit is snug through the hip and straight through the leg. A button closure sits below the natural waist, making the pants easy to pull on and off. Slant front pockets, belt loops, and back welt pockets ensure that these still look like true trousers, rather than leggings. Customers love the soft, stretchy fabric, and we have to agree. The mix of cotton and elastane provides all-day comfort for the wearer, without any scratchiness or uncomfortable feeling. We will be styling these with everything from button-down shirts and blazers to oversized knitwear and slim cardigan sets.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>0–20<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Length: </strong>Short–long&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-compressive-spanx-high-waist-flare-ponte-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Compressive</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx High Waist Flare Ponte Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx High Waist Flare Ponte Pants " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hkhNzfa4ItA5GnTMz-jFkZBVBKA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-high-waist-flare-ponte-pants-ec99488e8062422a915a1b6f880f42fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The core-shaping technology around the waistline is compressive.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The style runs long.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“If you want dress pants that feel like pajamas, the Spanx pants are the comfiest pants I have ever worn,” López says. A customer favorite and part of the brand’s “Perfect Pant” collection, these high-waisted flares are made from a stretchy, ponte fabric that smoothes and hides cellulite. It’s a pull-on silhouette that doesn’t have zippers or buttons. The signature, core-shaping technology adds a nipped-in feeling around the midsection, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in four colors, including black, navy, charcoal heather, and gray — these pants are quite easy to style with everything in your work wardrobe. “They pair great with an untucked blouse, sweater, or blazer or you can easily tuck in a bodysuit or mock neck into the waistband,” López recommends. We like them with both tucked and untucked top styles. Take a look at the inseam measurements though, to find the ideal fit for you. The brand recommends picking a shorter inseam, should you want to wear these pants with flats.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Rayon, nylon, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Length: </strong>Petite–tall</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-jcrew-cameron-slim-crop-pant-in-italian-stretch-wool-blend></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Cameron Slim Crop Pant in Italian Stretch Wool Blend</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Cameron Slim Crop Pant " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p4lkOg17wZEg8YfV9JiL9Rauf5s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jcrew-cameron-slim-crop-pant-8c36ce334f144123a07b3b025fb594e7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s available in classic and petite sizes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It does not come in tall or plus sizes.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fashion stylist Jenna Pizzuta is a fan of J.Crew’s Cameron Slim Crop Pant. “This particular style comes in petite and is a must-have for those who are looking for work pants that are comfortable and chic,” she says. The Cameron is made from high-quality wool, from one of Italy’s oldest mills, and has just a hint of stretch for all-day comfort. Whether you’ll be sitting at a desk all day, or spending long hours out on appointments, the pants are ideal for whatever work situation you face. We also are a fan of the brand’s signature Perfecting Pockets — designed to hold you in and lift the midsection — and that the trouser is lined, so no itchy feelings while wearing wool. Since this is a cropped silhouette, the petite variation ensures that the perfect hem length can be found, rather than being overwhelmingly long on shorter frames. Style with a slim turtleneck and loafers for a ’90s-inspired outfit, and just add the matching blazer when an extra layer is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–24<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Length: </strong>Petite, classic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-apiece-apart-merida-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Apiece Apart Merida Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Apiece Apart Merida Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8A0d2J8PYPwVHSqh3n5L321lL7U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/apiece-apart-merida-pant-ef9e1994417c47d4954861603c160f47.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The casual nature of the cotton fabric. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The pants run large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This is a great summer pant because of the cropped style and structured fabric,” Sethi explains. Made from 100 percent cotton, Apiece Apart’s Merida Pant is the brand’s best-selling pant style. High-waisted, wide-legged, and cropped above the ankle, it’s a classic trousers silhouette that feels perfect for warm-weather climates or offices during the summertime, when all you want is something breathable that doesn’t cling to the skin. Tuck in any type of top that you prefer — whether that be a button-down shirt, a silky blouse, or a jersey cotton top. “This core color will coordinate with any color top for any dress code and will look so polished,” Sethi advises. We recommend pairing with a flat, closed-toe shoe for an office with a stricter dress code or a simple, leather sandal for those with a more casual environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–12<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Length: </strong>25.5-inch inseam&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-loft-peyton-trouser-pants-in-bi-stretch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>LOFT Peyton Trouser Pants in Bi-Stretch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Loft Peyton Trouser Pants in Bi-Stretch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iWnf_2TgDPr3LuoPx-EbCETAYCg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loft-peyton-trouser-pants-in-bi-stretch-acabecb4afdf408baf8f9f6eab436e3b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Loft</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These come in a variety of lengths and sizes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They sell out quickly.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Loft’s Peyton style is one of López’s favorite trousers. “They offer the pants in various colors and materials each season and also come in tall, petite, curvy, and regular silhouettes,” she says. “The Peyton is super versatile, comfy, and [high-quality] for under $100.” This everyday trouser shape is relaxed through the hip, falling to a wider leg. Customers can choose their ideal inseam length with three different options — regular, petite, and tall. Design details include belt loops (this style looks even more elevated with a great belt!), plenty of pockets, and a front zip with a hook and bar closure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pair yours with everything from a crisp shirt to cashmere knits, striped tees, or a blazer for a full suit moment. Since the style is a wider, full leg, we would make sure to check inseams for the best length based on shoe preferences. If you are a flats fan, then you want to make sure that the pants will already graze the floor, without any extra height.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, rayon, spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–20/22<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Length:</strong> Petite–tall</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-banana-republic-lido-straight-italian-wool-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Banana Republic Lido Straight Italian Wool Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Banana Republic Lido Straight Italian Wool Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CRgJKnYtyANjXG-DlguBITH3odA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/banana-republic-lido-straight-italian-wool-pant-3b760d2622fc430796bd6745bce4c393.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Banana Republic</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The variety in hem lengths.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They are dry clean-only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Banana Republic has an extensive selection of petite and tall sizing, so it’s worth taking a look through the whole collection of work pants. However, Pizzuta recommends this full-length trouser. “One of my go-to brands for petite pants and this style is perfect for day to night,” she says. The Lido Straight is made from a soft and warm, Italian wool fabrication, ideal for cooler months. The cut is meant to elongate legs and also to be able to be worn with a heel. Since it was designed with this extra-long length in mind, be sure to check the inseam to find the ideal inseam for your specific height.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best part is they’re easy to style from day to night. For the office, pair them with a blouse and blazer.

She loves the dark gray color, but you can also go with the ever-classic black, too. The secret to this pants’ success is the Lift Tuck Technology, which features a slimming panel with a patented criss-cross design, that smoothes and shapes. The stretchy yet sculpting, ponte fabric adds even more lift to the overall feel — making it truly a compressive experience that you have to try to believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The straight-leg cut of the pants can be styled in a plethora of ways, as well. For corporate workplaces that have stricter guidelines, a blazer and long-sleeve blouse will pair perfectly. If a casual office is more of the vibe, then swap for a cute top and just add jewelry.

The material is also eco-friendly, being made from Lenzing Ecovero Viscose — a wood-based fiber that is responsibly sourced and produced through a process that reduces impact on forests and biodiversity.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of the season, these pants work well year-round.

You can always find tweed in every Maje collection. This pant truly represents the blend of classic, French style with a modern twist, that the brand does so beautifully. A simple, wide-leg design in a pastel jolt of color feels fresh and new, while button-front pockets (without a zipper fly) offer another interesting design spin to traditional workwear. The tweed fabric is thick enough to start wearing during the winter but can transition to spring nicely as well, thanks to the baby blue hue.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Pair them with a crisp blouse and tailored blazer to achieve a polished and professional look,” Pizzuta recommends.

The brand specializes in tailoring at a contemporary price point and the Demitria Pant is a customer and expert-approved favorite. “The mid-rise, skinny flare silhouette is classic, has almost a perfect five-star rating, and [is] great for tall girls with the long pant silhouette,” López remarks. Made from “Good Wool” (which is Theory’s answer to conscious manufacturing), it's a traceable fabric made from premium merino wool. The result is a luxe-to-the-touch fabric that is also breathable, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating, and resistant to odor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Choose from four colors — traditional black, navy, charcoal gray, and a burgundy malbec.

These flowy pants are tailored at the waistline while billowing out to a wide-leg silhouette that is effortless and pulled together. For us, the feature that sets these apart from any other pants is the stripes that race down the side of the leg. “Incorporating a unique detail, such as a stripe down the side or a hint of color blocking, brings that street style aesthetic to the office,” says Pizzuta. “The perfect desk-to-dinner pants that can be paired with any style of top.” We recommend letting the pants do the talking, and combining them with either a tonal top, inspired by the stripes colors, or something more vibrant, like a bold red, to add a little extra flavor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester, viscose<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>0–14<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Length: </strong>31.5-inch inseam</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curvy-fit-ann-taylor-the-eva-ankle-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curvy Fit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ann Taylor The Eva Ankle Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ann Taylor The Eva Ankle Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/tQDeqvEsvpFqNpX85e1UT97G65I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ann-taylor-the-eva-ankle-pant-fc9f99c8ae744a44a5e9dc747d81bce4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ann Taylor</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re offered in both classic and petite fits.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The 27-inch inseam might not work for taller figures.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ann Taylor’s best-selling Eva Ankle Pant now comes in a curvy fit — meaning the pant is fuller through the hip and thigh to provide the right fit for those with a smaller waist-to-hip ratio. Customers love the fit and the comfortable fabric which is primarily cotton, with a touch of spandex for give. Hitting right above the ankle, they are a slim-cut pant that creates a lengthening effect on the leg. A simple, front-zip closure, front and back pockets, and belt loops finish off the details of this trouser pant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Black, navy, and tan are the classic colors that are always available, but watch out for the seasonal hues as well (right now — there is a bold, berry pink that is giving us major Barbie vibes). Style with blouses, cut-and-sew tops, and more on top, and when it comes to footwear, the sky's the limit. Pointed pumps, ballet flats, or even a mid-calf boot will work with these pants.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–20/22<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Length: </strong>Petite, classic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-printed-veronica-beard-lebone-high-waist-flare-leg-plaid-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Printed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Veronica Beard Lebone High Waist Flare Leg Plaid Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Veronica Beard Lebone High Waist Flare Leg Plaid Pants " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dMTzyeIbPCGCIshKFhZaZOw5Z98=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/veronica-beard-lebone-high-waist-flare-leg-plaid-pants-f28ef99d013e4f14a69df01512e34db4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bergdorf Goodman</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The plaid weave is simple but bold.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Most retailers do not carry the extended sizing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Suiting is always a highlight in every Veronica Beard collection and the brand always finds a way to bring a twist to workwear classics. Case in point the Lebone plaid pants. “These high-waist, plaid pants will be that wow factor that helps you stand apart in the office,” says Pizzuta. “They are the perfect combination of sophistication and chic.” The traditional, men’s-inspired trousers get a feminine twist with a true flare leg and high-waisted fit. Made from a wool blend, these will be great on chillier days when you need a little extra warmth. Since this is a full-length flare, the 33.5-inch inseam might be long on petite customers, so be mindful when trying.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We envision wearing them as is with a classic blue, cotton button-down shirt and heeled loafers for warmer days, or layering up with the matching blazer, a turtleneck top, and knee-high boots for the colder months of the year.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool, polyester, viscose, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–24<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Length: </strong>34-inch inseam</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wide-leg-funyyzo-womens-wide-leg-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wide-Leg</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Funyyzo Wide Leg Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Funyyzo Women's Wide Leg Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rzYRwZmT151_dR04cMJhr0XVwWs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/funyyzo-womens-wide-leg-pants-99560616a63f4eb6b911ca2b808de946.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The price point is affordable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The pants are hand-wash only.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding a wide-leg pant that fits a range of body types is a feat but these seem to work for a great span. These pleat-front pants are high-waisted, creating a favorable look that the majority of reviewers liked. From the front, these pants look like your typical trousers,&nbsp; but turn them around and you’ll find that the back boasts a hidden elastic waistband. This elasticity provides an element of comfort and flexibility that most trousers don’t offer. You can also easily conceal the elastic waistband with a belt since the standard belt loops were still kept on the design. The fluid fabric is comfortable and non-constricting and you can’t beat the price and diverse color options.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Styling these pants is pretty effortless.

These trouser pants run from 00–40, making them the most inclusive on our list. The soft, relaxed, stretch flannel material is the perfect base for the effortless, straight-leg design. Two button-fastening at the waist makes this an easy style to step into and there is an elastic back waistband for comfort and added stretch.

With more workplaces being relaxed in dress codes, denim isn’t off the table entirely. We recommend looking for a silhouette that feels just like a trouser, in a dark wash with no stretch. Madewell’s Superwide-Leg style covers all these bases and more. The twisted, center-front seams give the denim a polished edge, making it a bit more dress code-acceptable. 100 percent cotton denim fabrication gives the jeans a thicker feel and heavier weight that feel more dressed up.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still, you’ll want to keep things professional when it comes to styling.

Since the inseam is 32 inches, depending on your height, hemming may be required if you want to wear flats, but a heeled shoe should also do the trick if that is too finicky for you.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Polyester<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–28<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Length: </strong>32-inch inseam</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leggings-mmlafleur-the-skinny-foster-pant-powerstretch></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leggings</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>M.M.LaFleur The Skinny Foster Pant Powerstretch</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="M.M.LaFleur The Skinny Foster Pant Powerstretch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/QvLHaKeFdck4TMhQ3H354c-lRXE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mmlafleur-the-skinny-foster-pant-powerstretch-b69d27e7d7c34351aa1b256b44f4cd2d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>M.M.LaFleur</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The thick fabric feels great without looking like activewear.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The brand says this style runs small.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">M.M.LaFleur’s founders created the brand to take the work out of daily dressing. By focusing on timeless essentials that can be mixed, matched, and worn with practically everything, the collection focuses on quality fabrics, on-point fits, and comfort. If wide legs are not your thing, or perhaps you are just looking for some variety in your pant shapes, The Skinny Foster Pant is a great solution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made from an Italian power stretch material, it’s an opaque fabric that is machine-washable. The true skinny silhouette has a fully tapered leg that has a clean, seamless front and faux back pockets (to keep them from looking too casual). We adore the notch details on the ankles adding another element of stylish design. Try these with a tunic-length top or sweater and pointy flat shoe, then top with a trench coat and tote bag, for an effortless approach to a day at the office.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, nylon, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>00–20<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Length:</strong> 29-inch inseam</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-argent-stretch-wool-wide-leg-trousers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Argent Stretch Wool Wide Leg Trousers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Argent Stretch Wool Wide Leg Trousers " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hMQyaaFHns4AqEFEj6hkUxuGhbo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/argent-stretch-wool-wide-leg-trousers-1006ed575a054ea8ad8f18128b26b636.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There are four fun, vibrant colors to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no extended sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Argent is another contemporary brand that is taking the guesswork out of the everchanging codes of workplace dressing while offering styles that emphasize personal style and self-expression. The extensive line of suiting comes in so many colors that make dressing for a day at the office or business meetings exciting. The Stretch Wool Wide Leg Trousers are very classic in design but the vibrant color choices make them stand out, in our opinion. Although these pants are made from wool, this fabric is intended to be worn year-round. The material has a touch of stretch for comfort, and is temperature-regulating, while being odor- and wrinkle-resistant, due to its natural core. Dress these up with a blazer and pumps when going for a power look with attitude, or take them to a casual level with a T-shirt and sneakers. They’re that versatile.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>0–14<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Length: </strong>32-inch inseam</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fabric</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pay attention to the fabric because it's the unsung hero of your work ensemble,” Pizzuta says. She recommends looking for pants with a bit of stretch to ensure you can move freely without feeling restricted. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Amazon Essentials’ Skinny Ankle Pant</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Spanx’s High Waist Flare Ponte Pants</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">NYDJ’s Sculpt-Her Classic Trousers</a> are all great examples of this, with the latter two offering light compression for a sculpted effect. “Plus, the right fabric can elevate the overall aesthetic, taking you from casual Fridays to boardroom Mondays with ease,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sethi also believes that a pants’ fabric influences the lever that makes them read more casual or formal. She also suggests taking into account the seasons and climate where you live. “In Manhattan in the summer, you may want to wear a lightweight fabric that won’t trap heat,” she says. Her recommendation is a natural fiber blend that will ensure the fabric doesn’t trap heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Fabrication is important to López as well, who favors polyester, jersey, and other synthetic fibers, to ensure the pants aren’t see-through in direct light or show panty lines. “Higher quality pants will have stretch comfort to them — they won’t ripple or tear if you’re sitting down — [because they’re made from a double-paneled, double-stitched, thick material],” she says.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The fit is like the backbone of work pants. You're after a fit that feels just right — not too tight, not too loose — providing both comfort and freedom of movement,” says Pizzuta. “A well-tailored fit not only looks polished but also boosts your confidence.” She’s petite, which is a significant factor that shapes her entire shopping experience for work pants. “It's all about finding work pants that are not just a fit for the workplace but also a perfect fit for my petite frame,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">López also recommends looking at silhouettes that work for your body, personal style, and comfort. “Do you like more fitted, slim, or skinny pants? Do you prefer high-waist versus mid-rise? Do you like your pants to be cropped and hit your ankle or graze the ground when you wear <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>work heels</a>?” These are the questions and factors that she considers when purchasing a pair of pants. Investing in a pair that you will wear regularly and that fits well is more important than cheaper styles that are ill-fitting.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sethi also explains that silhouettes can be very confusing for a lot of people because this involves what’s trending in the market. Right now she says brands are focusing on straight and wide-leg styles, but in the past skinny, fitted pants were the fashion. For this reason, she stresses the importance of investing in various silhouettes, so you don’t have the same styles in your wardrobe.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Versatility&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Look for versatile styles that can seamlessly transition from meetings to post-work plans,” Pizzuta says. “Versatility isn't just about the look but also about how easily your pants can adapt to different occasions, making your mornings a tad less stressful.” Finding shapes that can go from desk to dinner and more will be beneficial to creating a concise, well-organized wardrobe&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Design Details&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For López, it’s all about the waistband and zipper, when it comes to design details. “Higher quality pants have a structured waistband and include a zipper, button, or fastener,” she says. “Cheaper pants will have an elastic waistband that might roll or not hold its shape after a wear or one time through the washing machine.” She also recommends looking at the quality of the zipper, buttons, and fasteners. “Is the zipper longer than two inches so you can easily pull the pants over your hips? Is it a metal or plastic zipper? Is the button tightly secured or a thin plastic button that doesn’t hold the waistband together?” Think about these as you shop.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sethi however looks at the color options a brand offers. “Color is another lever to investing in polished work pants,” she says. “I always advise my clients to invest in the four colors — black, gray, white, and navy — as they are the most versatile and you’ll get many outfits out of them.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle

litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Work pants can widely range based on your office environment, dress code, company culture, location, and type of industry,” López says. “Pants will differ in silhouette, fit, color, material, and how they are styled with the rest of the outfit.” All three of our experts categorize office environments into two main categories — traditional office jobs (which tend to be more strict when it comes to dress codes) and creative workplaces (which tend to be on the casual side).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a traditional office job with a corporate environment and business-formal dress code, López recommends looking for trousers that will mainly be neutral, paired with a button-down shirt or blouse, and sometimes a blazer. “The silhouettes should be simple, timeless, and classic with minimal detailing, hardware, and design,” she says. “They will be skinny, tapered, straight, or wide-legged for finance, law, and sales jobs.” Pizzuta encourages sticking with the classics as well, such as a black or navy tailored trouser, for a more formal place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For a creative office job with a more relaxed environment and dress code, you have a little more flexibility with the dress pants,” López explains. “You can wear color [and] prints, and pair them with a sweater, T-shirt, and even the occasional sneaker or cool street shoe.” She says the depth of styles can range from wide-leg, palazzo, prints, matching belts, and embellishments when it comes to jobs in media, public relations, marketing, creative, and start-ups. “For a laid-back office, khakis or maybe some stylish ankle pants could do the trick,” Pizzuta adds. “And if it's a creative space, wide-leg pants or even sleek, modern cuts.” These are all good, generic rules to follow.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sethi recommends looking at both the color and fabric of the pants. “Most people would think darker, more structured fabrics (navy, wool pants) are more appropriate for a formal, conservative office, while lighter colored, more casual fabrics, such as linen, are typically more appropriate for more casual offices,” she says.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading

commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There seem to be a lot of rules when it comes to workplace dressing, but our experts have a few simple tips. “Consider a capsule wardrobe for versatile mixing and matching,” Pizzuta says. “Experiment with colors and subtle patterns while maintaining a professional tone.” She recommends remembering that the key is to strike a balance between professionalism and personal style. “Feel confident and comfortable in your outfit, and you'll be ready to conquer the workday with style,” she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">López and Sethi’s styling philosophies are a little more direct. “Pair skinny, straight, or slim dress pants with a blouse or sweater that you can leave untucked or loosely tucked into the waistband,” López recommends. “The larger proportion on top will be balanced with the skinniness of the pants.” If you have wide-legs, flares, or relaxed dress pants, she suggests pairing them with a fitted top, mock neck, or shirt and adding a belt and pointed shoe — pump, loafer, or boot — to elongate the legs. “The belt will accentuate the waist and the pointed shoe will help draw the eye down your leg and end in a nice point,” she says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For Sethi, simple combinations work the best. “If you need an outfit for a formal dress code, pair pants with a blouse and blazer on top,” she says. “For a casual dress code, you can opt for a jeans jacket, a high-quality shirt, and sneakers.”&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2
