I haven't been able to do that [with you]," the 30-year-old restaurateur reasoned to Hebert during an intimate dinner date.</p><p>Asked by Hebert why his feelings changed after such a positive hometown date (as seen on the July 18 episode), Tzortsis launched into a speech that ended in his exit.</p><p>"I'd want ideally for me to be madly head over heels [in love with you]; 100% sure and ready to meet your father and say 'I want to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage,'" he told a stunned Hebert, 26.</p><p>"I have too much respect for you, for myself, for my family and ultimately your family also, to do anything but that. I know what the fantasy suite means and implies. I knew if I got to this point and I wasn't in love with you, I wouldn't accept the fantasy suite. I haven't pretended and I don't want to start now," he continued, referring to the show's overnight dates that occur behind closed doors. "I don't want to make it any harder than it has to be. I don't think I can look back at one point and say I wasn't ready to find love. I was. Had it been there."</p><p>Though she appreciated her suitor's honestly, Hebert was visibly overwhelmed. "I thought we were taking steps forward," she reasoned. "I'm shocked he didn't at least give it the time to see if there was anything there."</p><p>Tzortsis' admission wasn't the only bombshell Hebert had to contend with on Monday's show.</p><p>Booted bachelor <strong>Ryan Park</strong> traveled to Fiji in an attempt to rekindle the love he felt he lost with Hebert.</p><p>"I didn't feel that passion, which I need in relationships," Hebert told Park. "I found that with two people."</p><p>At the conclusion of the episode, it was clear Hebert indeed made a lasting connection with final two bachelors <strong>Ben Flajnik</strong> and <strong>JP Rosenbaum</strong>.</p><p>Though she extended a rose to both men, Hebert still held the rose ceremony to test her suitors' intentions.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"This is a two-way street and guys could leave," she said. "It doesn't necessarily mean [JP and Ben] are going to fall in love with me. I was hurt and I might be hurt again, but I'm hoping there is a reward at the end of this."</p><p>The season finale of The Bachelorette airs August 1 at 8 p.m. (EST) on ABC.</p><p>By <strong>Allison Corneau</strong> for <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>.
