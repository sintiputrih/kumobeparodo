Fortunately, the director permitted him to audition and informed him that he is an Italian from Brooklyn. Martinet had intended to speak in a stereotypically Italian deep, raspy voice, but he later decided that it would be too harsh for the kids to hear. Then he softened it and made it more friendlier, culminating in Mario’s voice as we know it today. According to Charles, the character of ‘Petruchio’ from William Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew” served as inspiration for his depiction of Mario.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/download-6-2.jpg><p>Hard Traveling was released in 1986, The Deadpool was released in 1988, Mom was released in 1991, Nine Months was released in 1995, and Criminal Hearts was released in 1996.

His voice can be heard in both English and Japanese versions.</p><p>In the Super NES game Super Punch-Out, he supplied the voice over for the boxers and announcers.
