The city’s largest trading district was Thorin, the location of the excavated pottery workshop. Thorin became the center of pottery production in the area. Artifacts date back as early as the 13th century.</p><p>In the case of the excavated pottery workshop, researchers have found evidence that the site was used as early as the 12th century.</p><p>“The first activity on the site was the extraction of natural red sand from the 12th century, according to the ceramic furniture collected in several pits arranged in a battery to the east of the site,” the press release stated. However, most of the pottery originates from the 16th and 17th centuries.</p><p>After the shop closed around the 17th century, other buildings were constructed on top of it, burying the kilns deeper beneath the soil. Now that it’s been unearthed once again, researchers are eager to see what else the site has to reveal about the history of Montreuil-sur-Mer.</p><p>After reading about the pottery workshop discovered in France, learn about <a href=#>China’s Terracotta Army</a> and its 7,000 clay soldiers.
