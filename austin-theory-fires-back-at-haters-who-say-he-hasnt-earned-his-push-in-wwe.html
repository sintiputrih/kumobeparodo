He also had humble beginnings thanks to Johnny Gargano’s stable, The Way, in NXT. Then he finally made his way to the main roster and received the push of a lifetime.</p><p>Theory had a remarkable year in WWE, as he experienced a brilliant WrestleMania 38 moment with Steve Austin, won the United States Title, and then went on to win&nbsp;<a href=#>the Men’s Money In The Bank match</a>. Now he is Mr. Money in the Bank and still has that briefcase in tow.</p><p>Through his success, he has also invited plenty of doubters, those who don’t think he deserved his spot at such a young age. While speaking with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ringer Wrestling Show</a>, Austin Theory addressed his critics, as he hit back at his haters who claim he has not earned his push in WWE.</p><p>“I think a lot of those people, the people that do know the story and the people that don’t – when you think about it, any time somebody is really young, it seems like ‘oh they’ve been given this.’ But think about, I started working out at 12 because at eight years old I saw WWE. My mom was sneaking me in the gym – I had to be 13 to go to the gym, but I was sneaking in at 12 because I saw a video of John Morrison training abs and Triple H. It was a WWE workout video. I just wanted to start preparing myself for that because that’s all I wanted to do.</p><p>I played sports before I figured out what WWE was, and if you think about that, I quit playing sports at around eight. I just worked out and was like, ‘I don’t want to get injured, I don’t want to rely on a team.’ That’s just my mindset. For me, that was my mentality. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to get here as fast as I can….once they gave me that debut, I was like, ‘This is mine.’ It’s a long story, but I think why people say that is because the age is young.”&nbsp;</p><p>Austin Theory was unable to defeat Bobby Lashley for the United States Championship at WWE SummerSlam, and then he never got a chance to cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase before Brock Lesnar destroyed him with an F5. We’ll have to see what is next in store for him, but it seems he has a good head on his shoulders.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
