I know that Normal is supposed to be the "plain and boring" type, but imo that description unintentionally fit the Fighting-type a lot more: from day 1 Normal had its share of very unusual designs and creatures such as computer programs, cute little cryptids, vaguely axolotl-like nurses, kangaroosaurus moms, and whatever the heck the Lickitung line's supposed to be. Fighting on the other hand for a very long time had virtually all of its designs being just some flavor of humanoid martial artist, meaning a lot of them were very samey. The first Fighting-type I truly liked and that remains on the tippy top of my favorites to this day was <b>Breloom</b> both because I found it cute and because it was just so strange for its type (though granted, being part Grass probably helped). Next was the <b>Lucario line</b>, which yeah, makes me sound like a huge hypocrite because it is essentially just a "humanoid martial artist" too, but what helped that one is that it's a dog and I am a huge sucker for dogs. But then Gen 5 is when Fighting designs were kicked into high gear: we got punk lizards that cleverly use their shed skin as makeshift clothes in the <b>Scraggy line</b>, elegant (a design descriptor not seen often in the Fighting-type, since most try extremely hard to be as macho as possible) Xiaolin mustelids in the <b>Mienfoo line</b>, and even a group of quadrupeds (a first for this type and something I honestly never thought would ever be done) in the Musketeers. Gen 8 also brought us other very fun concepts for Fighting-types like a shield wolf and a troop of adorable roman warriors.<p>TL; DR, Fighting started out incredibly restricted in its designs, but once it expanded its horizons into what the concept of the word "Fighting" means, it truly came into its own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorPAq5uepl6jsrV706GpnpmUqHy6u9SrZJ%2BZpqTCs7XTnmSpp5uaurC6jKidZrGfqr9uuMSaqq1llpbDsMHRoqueZaSuvaZ6kXFpbWtjZL2is8Rmag%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
