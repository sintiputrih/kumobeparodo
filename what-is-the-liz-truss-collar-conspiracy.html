What began as discussions about her political history and qualifications for the role have recently seen a shift, as people turn their attention to a seemingly benign detail. Conversations of late have focused on the 47-year-old‚Äôs choice of accessory, and whether or not her style of necklace is a nod to the BDSM community.</p><h2 id=h-the-liz-truss-collar-conspiracy data-injectable=false>The Liz Truss collar conspiracy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Liz_Truss_collar.jpg><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>Within days of Truss stepping into the role of Prime Minister, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">strange new rumor</a> was starting to spread online. Members of the BDSM community quickly took notice of one of Truss‚Äôs favorite accessories, and spiraled into a now-viral conspiracy theory about Truss‚Äôs after-dark activities.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>Members of the BDSM community are convinced that Truss is a submissive, as indicated through her consistent use of O-ring necklaces. In the world of BDSM, people typically fall into two categories: dominant and submissive. It‚Äôs common practice for those who fall into the ‚Äúsubmissive‚Äù group to don leather collars when spending time with their dom partners, and sometimes in their day-to-day lives.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>Truss can‚Äôt simply don a leather collar for her next high-profile press conference, of course, but BDSM regulars believe she‚Äôs still putting out some pretty clear signals with her choice of necklace. Truss has been photographed on several occasions with a selection of O-ring necklaces, which people online are linking back to day-collars ‚Äî or the work-appropriate collars worn by subs in their regular lives ‚Äî and using them as proof that she‚Äôs a closet member of the BDSM community.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Liz Truss collar theorists are sleeping on the fact that it‚Äôs not just one, ol girl owns at least two distinct o ring necklaces <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/YhY5yCI0kQ</a></p>‚Äî worms cited (@christapeterso) <a href=#>September 11, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>The necklaces that Truss often dons are all far more subtle than your typical leather collar, but they share distinct qualities with the day collars worn by many subs in the community. She‚Äôs certainly a fan of the style, as pointed out by numerous people online, who are noting that Truss wears the specific style of necklace quite consistently.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>Conspiracy theories soon spiraled out of control on Twitter, where members of the BDSM community are hard at work convincing the world that Truss is a not-so-subtle sub.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Liz Truss wears a day collar.

One user even spiraled into a fully-realized, well-sourced tirade about Truss‚Äôs ‚Äúpossible d/s relationship and her use of the day collar.‚Äù By the end, she‚Äôd made true believers of a number of readers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Okay folks buckle the fuck up because I have some more news about Liz Truss‚Äô possible d/s relationship and her use of the day collar and I have to say I‚Äôm a true believer.

Her name is increasingly cropping up in correlation with the O-ring necklace and day-collar conspiracies, a fact that will likely force her to eventually address her connections to the BDSM community. Kink isn‚Äôt a popular topic among most politicians ‚Äî outside of the bedroom, at least ‚Äî so chances are good that Truss will deny it, but real believers know the truth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaSdsm64yLNkraqlqMBur86lo5qqXZi8r7%2FPoqmam6lk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
