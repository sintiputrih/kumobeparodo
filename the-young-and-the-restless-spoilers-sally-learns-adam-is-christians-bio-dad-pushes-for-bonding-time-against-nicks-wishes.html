Will Sally push Adam to go after bonding time against Nick Newman’s (Joshua Morrow) wishes?</p><p>Adam and Nick have actually started bonding as brothers again, so Y&R will eventually need another reason for them to fight.</p><p>It’s inevitable when we’re talking about the Newman family! Perhaps it’s time to revive a buried issue and bring Adam’s role in Christian’s life back into the story.</p><p>It’d be timely considering everything that’s going on with Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), who’s Dominic Newman-Abbott-Chancellor’s bio dad and not his legal father.</p><p>Since Y&R is showing Devon’s struggles, shouldn’t they show Adam’s struggles, too?</p><p>The situation is a little different, but Adam at least deserves to play an uncle type of role here. It seems cruel to cut Adam off from Christian completely, which is what Nick did in the past.</p><p>We should also note that Christian’s name came up again recently for the first time in what feels like forever.</p><p>It could be significant that Nick’s mentioning Christian, especially if Sally becomes privy to the complicated family drama.</p><p>After Sally had success bonding with Connor Newman (Judah Mackey), she gave herself a pat on the back. Sally surprised herself by having the “mom gene” – at least according to her!</p><p>It’s easy to imagine Sally making a mess of things by getting updates on Adam’s bio dad status and urging him to fight for a spot in Christian’s life.</p><p>Sally might mention her own feelings of abandonment due her messed-up parents and difficult family history.</p><p>This story would also give Sally and Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) a reason to keep feuding.</p><p>That’s a war the show seems interested in keeping alive, so here’s their chance to create more conflict.</p><p>Phyllis would no doubt lash out at Sally for thinking she’s some motherly expert and for stirring up Christian trouble when it wasn’t her place to.</p><p>Nick brought up how much Christian loved Phyllis, so all the pieces would be in place for this intriguing storyline.</p><p>Do you think Sally will learn Nick is raising Adam’s biological son?</p><p>Will Sally’s “mom gene” drive her to make a mess and push Adam to be in Christian’s life? We’ll keep you posted as other news pops up.</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers say Sally certainly isn’t done with Adam – nor is she done causing problems in Genoa City!</p><p>CDL will have other hot <a href=# rel=noopener>Young and the Restless spoilers, news and updates to</a> read up on, so stick with us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWpnpJ2ybsXOrqWgZZGjsW7Ax55kq52jqbmmv9JmqqmnmaGys7%2BMrJilpKliuaat0aeqZpmUlrputdJmmqGqmajBqq3NrGSboZ9isaKwjKmsrKCVqHqnu9FmmaimlJ67qHnToqSeZZGcrqq60q1kp6GToMBuw8isn56rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
