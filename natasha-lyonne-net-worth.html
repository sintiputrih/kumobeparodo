Natasha is an actress, best known for being part of the “American Pie” films as the character Jessica. She’s also had parts in other films, including “Blade: Trinity”, “Everyone Says I Love You” and “But I’m a Cheerleader”. All of her efforts have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Natasha Lyonne? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $3 million, mostly earned through a successful career as an actress. Aside from film, she’s been also known for her television work and has performed on stage too. She’s won several awards, and as she continues her career her wealth will likely increase.</p><h3>Natasha Lyonne Net Worth $3 million</h3><p>After living in New York for a while, Natasha and her family moved to Israel, but after their parents’ divorce she and her mother moved back to New York. She attended Ramaz School but was expelled after getting caught selling marijuana. She then attended Miami Country Day School, and lived independently from when she was 16 years old. Soon after, she started pursuing her acting career more seriously, and attended New York University for a while to study film and philosophy.</p><p>Prior to becoming an adult actress, Natasha was already signed to the Ford Modelling Agency. One of her first film opportunities came at “Pee-wee’s Playhouse”. She then took roles in “Dennis the Menace”, “Heartburn” and “A Man Called Sarge”. She was six years old during the time of these films.</p><p>Later on at the age of 16, she would be cast in the film “Everyone Says I Love You” which would lead to more acting opportunities. She then became part of the indie film “Slums of Beverly Hills”, and was soon cast for major film roles including “Scary Movie 2”, “Kate and Leopold” and “Blade:Trinity”. She also made a guest appearance in “Will and Grace” before becoming part of the “American Pie” films. She continued making films even while busy with theatre and television projects. Some of her most recent films include “Girl Most Likely”, “4:44 – Last Day on Earth” and “All About Evil”.</p><p>Lyonne’s stage debut came in a production of “Two Thousand Years” which was an award winning play. She was then a part of “Love, Loss, and What I Love” which was based on the book by Ileen Beckerman. She continued to receive good reviews and then acted in “Tigers Be Still”, and “Blood from Stone”. Her net worth was rising.</p><p>For television, Natasha has made guest appearances in many popular television series, such as “New Girl”, “Weeds” and “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”. Her current television series is from Netflix and it is entitled “Orange is the New Black”, in which she stars as the character Nicky Nichols, and which has brought her a Primetime Emmy nomination for her performance. This marks the first time that she has become a regular cast member of a television series.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that Lyonne has had her share of legal problems. She was convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol in 2001 and 2002. She was also arrested after threatening her neighbor, which eventually led to her being evicted by her landlord. She’s also had a number of health problems – Lyonne was once hospitalized because of a collapsed lung, a heart infection and hepatitis C. She underwent open heart surgery to fix the heart infection damage, but recovered soon after. There is no public information on any relationships.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=19.333643988816><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Natasha Lyonne</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 4, 1979</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New York City, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 3½" (1.61 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Ramaz School, Miami Country Day School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Aaron Braunstein, Yvette Braunstein</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Adam Braunstein</td></tr><tr readability=0.25396825396825><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/Natasha-Lyonne-240832766110076</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.41176470588235><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/nlyonne</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.41860465116279><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/nlyonne/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005169/</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>Screen Actors Guild Award - Best Ensemble in a Comedy Series (2015), Young Hollywood Award for Best Ensemble Cast (2000)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Awards, Teen Choice Awards for Choice Movie (1999)</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>Movies</td><td>“Blade: Trinity”, “Everyone Says I Love You”, “But I’m a Cheerleader”,“Slums of Beverly Hills”, “Scary Movie 2”, “Kate and Leopold”, “Girl Most Likely”, “4:44 – Last Day on Earth”, “All About Evil”</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>TV Shows</td><td>“New Girl”, “Weeds”, “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit”, “American Pie”, “Orange Is the New Black” (2013-2018), “Portlandia” (2015-2017)</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=19.932432432432><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=5.9138755980861><td>1</td><td>[on performing her role as a cat-loving school teacher in <a href=#>G.B.F.</a> (2013)'] If you're at all a reasonable human being when you're 34 years old, you don't read scripts looking at the children's parts.
