Likewise, Pliskova won her maiden WTA title at the Malaysian Open in 2013.</p><p>In the final, the 31-year-old defeated <strong>Bethanie Mattek-Sands</strong> to start a title-winning spree that has seen Karolina win 16 singles titles as of now.</p><p>After that, Pliskova’s next big career highlight happened during the 2016 U.S Open, where she reached her first Grand Slam final.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-31.jpg><p>On her way to the final, the Czech native knocked out extremely tough opposition. None more so than 23-time Grand Slam champion <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Serena Williams</a>.</strong></p><p>However, in the finale, Karolina had a breakdown as she lost the match from a very favorable position.</p><p>Nonetheless, Pliskova bounced back from her misery and regained her winning ways.
