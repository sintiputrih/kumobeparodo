They told me I could order anything on the menu and my eyes went straight for the largest ice cream sundae on the menu — the classic Banana Split.</p><p>I have the best memories of sitting on those swivel bar stools, eating the best banana split in the world, and spending time with my grandparents. Every time they asked me where I wanted to go for dessert, I would always say the old-fashioned ice cream shop.&nbsp;</p><p>So I wanted to create homemade banana splits at home with all of the ingredients made from scratch. It was so fun to make a banana split toppings bar for my kids and their friends. They loved it! I am sharing my banana split recipe and how easy it is to make at home.</p><p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center block-tip__title has-x-large-font-size">What is a Banana Split?</h2></p><p>A banana split is a classic American dessert that originated in the 1900s and has become a classic ice cream dessert. A classic banana split is an American ice cream-based dessert consisting of a peeled banana in half lengthwise and served with ice cream and sauce between the two pieces.</p><p>There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with three scoops of ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry). The sauces (chocolate hot fudge, strawberry, and pineapple) are drizzled onto the ice cream, which is topped with whipped cream and maraschino cherries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Banana-Split-3-720x714.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Best Banana Split Ingredients:</h2><p>These ingredients are layered and arranged in a long dish or banana split boat, typically with the banana halves on each side of the dish and the scoops of ice cream placed in between. The toppings are then drizzled over the ice cream, followed by a dollop of whipped cream, a sprinkle of chopped nuts, and a cherry on top.</p><ul><li><strong>Fresh Banana</strong>: You want to use a ripe banana that isn’t too mushy. If it has brown spots, it’ll probably be too soft. You can read more on that below.</li><li><strong>Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry Ice Cream</strong>: The ice cream brand itself isn’t that important, just make sure that it’s a kind that you know you love! You can even try to make some homemade ice cream, I’ve listed some of my best recipes below.</li><li><strong>Strawberry Sauce</strong>: Although you can buy some at the store, from scratch is super simple! Homemade strawberry sauce is made with thinly sliced fresh strawberries, sugar, and lemon juice. They’re heated all together until they’re combined into a thick syrup.</li><li><strong>Hot Fudge Sauce</strong>: Once again, this is something that could be store bought, or you can use my easy hot fudge sauce recipe. This is truly the best way to make hot fudge sauce, and it takes any dessert to another level. Rich and fudgy chocolate pairs well with the chocolate ice cream and really ties everything together.</li><li><strong>Pineapple Sauce</strong>: This pineapple sauce is really as easy as it gets! Just chopped fresh pineapple, brown sugar, and water. Sweet and tangy, it’s the perfect topping to bring together the ice cream and the banana.</li><li><strong>Whipped Cream</strong>: Homemade or store bought, whipped cream adds some light and fluffy texture that balances out the heavy cream of ice cream.</li><li><strong>Maraschino Cherry</strong>: The perfect topping!</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Banana-Split-4-720x608.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make a Homemade Banana Split:</h2><li><strong>Start with firm bananas that aren’t too ripe</strong>.

The ice cream will be placed in the middle of the two bananas.</li><li><strong>Place three scoops of ice cream — vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate — in the center of the banana</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>If you want to make homemade sauces, make hot fudge, strawberry sauce, and pineapple sauces</strong>.
