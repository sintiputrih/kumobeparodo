Presented in "real-time," each season of the show followed one day, with each episode showcasing an hour. This action drama featured a Counterterrorism Unit, known as CTU, headed by Jack Bauer. Their mission was to prevent terror attacks from taking place in the United States. This had never been done before, and the show's creativity led to universal acclaim. The show won several awards during its run, including a Golden Globe in 2004 for Best Drama Series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not every season of the series was popular, however, with some later seasons receiving criticism for the portrayal of villains or reusing plots. The show was criticized for being too violent and glorifying torture, but nevertheless, it rose from disapproval and went on to win a multitude of awards. From the first season to the spin-off, <a href=#><strong>24: Legacy</strong></a>, here is a ranking of the best and worst days in the series' history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sharedimages/2024/04/24-tv-series-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title=24>24</a></h5>TV-14DramaCrimeAction<p class=display-card-description></p><strong>Release Date</strong> <span>November 6, 2001</span> <strong>Creator(s)</strong> <span>Robert Cochran , Joel Surnow</span> <strong>Cast</strong> <span><a data-id href=#>Kiefer Sutherland</a> , Mary Lynn Rajskub , Carlos Bernard , <a data-id href=#>Dennis Haysbert</a> , <a data-id href=#>Elisha Cuthbert</a> , James Morrison</span> <strong>Seasons</strong> <span>8</span><h2 id=39-24-legacy-39><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>'24: Legacy'</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-february-5-2017>Premiered on February 5, 2017</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/24-legacy-eric-carter.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After returning to U.S. soil, Eric Carter (<strong>Corey Hawkins</strong>) finds out that he and his military squad mates are the targets of assassins following the death of their leader. With nowhere else to turn, Carter requests the help of CTU to help him stop what could be one of the largest-scale terror attacks in America.</p><p>A continuation of the original series, 24: Legacy, had a 12-episode run that attempted to introduce new characters to the world created in the original 24 series. The shortened season still utilized the "real-time" presentation, but the finale featured a 12-hour time jump due to the shorter length.</p><h2 id=day-6><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Day 6</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-january-14-2007>Premiered on January 14, 2007</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24-day-6.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Set 20 months after Day 5, Jack Bauer is released after being illegally held by Chinese government agents. He works with CTU to take down terrorists who are threatening the United States with nuclear weapons. Over the course of the day, Bauer discovers that members of his own family may be involved.</p><p>The sixth season of 24 received mixed reviews upon release, with critics and audiences criticizing many aspects of the plot, especially the storyline that involved Bauer's family members â€” the season brought back several of the series' past cast members, including <strong>D.B. Woodside</strong> as Wayne Palmer, the newest President of the United States and brother to former President, David Palmer.</p><h2 id=day-8><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Day 8</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-january-17-2010>Premiered on January 17, 2010</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24-day-8.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Returning to CTU to help stop a terrorist plot to end peace talks between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Kamistan, Jack Bauer goes undercover alongside Renee Walker (<strong>Annie Wersching</strong>) to stop the Russian terrorists.

Originally planned as the series' final season, Day 8 wrapped up several longstanding plot lines from previous seasons.</p><h2 id=day-3><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Day 3</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-october-28-2003>Premiered on October 28, 2003</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/24-season-3-chase-edmunds.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack Bauer and President David Palmer (<strong>Dennis Haysbert</strong>) work together to try and stop the release of a deadly virus by Stephen Saunders (<strong>Paul Blackthorne</strong>).

The season also introduced <strong>Mary Lynn Rajskub</strong> as Chloe O'Brian, who went on to become one of the series' biggest regulars.</p><h2 id=24-live-another-day><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>24: Live Another Day</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-may-5-2014>Premiered on May 5, 2014</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24-live-another-day.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the United States and the United Kingdom meet to negotiate a treaty in London, ex-CTU agent Jack Bauer emerges from exile to help stop a plot that will weaken all the world's major governments. After saving President Heller's (<strong>William Devane</strong>) life, Jack Bauer finds that a former enemy is still alive and has an even more dangerous plan in motion.</p><p>Presented as a continuation to the series, this miniseries received acclaim from critics for being a better conclusion than its predecessor. As a miniseries, <a href=#><strong>24: Live Another Day</strong></a> featured 12 episodes presented in "real-time," with a 12-hour time jump occurring in the series finale. While praised by critics, the series had a tough time getting off the ground, and ultimately could not get away from the flaws of the original series.</p><h2 id=day-7><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Day 7</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-january-11-2009>Premiered on January 11, 2009</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24-day-7.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On trial for his alleged crimes, while working for CTU, Jack Bauer escapes custody. He goes undercover alongside his former allies, Bill Buchanan (<strong>James Morrison</strong>), Chloe O'Brian, and Tony Almeida (<strong>Carlos Bernard</strong>), to stop a warlord and save President Taylor.</p><p>Following the controversial sixth season, critics found season seven to be a return to form for the aging series. With a plot involving long-time character Tony Almeida as an antagonist, Day 7 explored new dilemmas while reusing some plot devices. The show was impacted by the Writer's strike in 2007, ultimately delaying the premiere. Executives at Fox wanted the season to air uninterrupted, which benefited the show in that they were able to map out the entire season beforehand and allow for a better perspective on the production value. Season 7 sits at a 76% on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=day-2><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Day 2</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-october-29-2002>Premiered on October 29, 2002</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24-season-2.jpg><p>After retiring from CTU, former agent Jack Bauer is brought back into the fold by President David Palmer, who informs Jack of an impending nuclear attack in Los Angeles.

Co-creator, <strong>Joel Surnow</strong> said that he originally wanted to change the formatting in season 2, so each episode spanned 24 hours instead of one hour of real-time, but the idea was shot down. The season was applauded by critics and was nominated for major Emmy Awards, including Best Drama Series and Best Lead Actor to Kiefer Sutherland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=day-4><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Day 4</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-january-9-2005>Premiered on January 9, 2005</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/24-season-4-jack-bauer.jpg><p>After being fired by CTU, Jack Bauer must work alongside his former agency to stop a terrorist named Habib Marwan (<strong>Arnold Vosloo</strong>), who has several plans to harm America and its citizens.

Critics praised the season for its high concept and the performances from the cast, most notably Kiefer Sutherland. Season 1 is the only season of the original series that did not feature a President of the United States or a White House Chief of Staff. The season featured many twists and turns and kept audiences on the edge of their seat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=day-5><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Day 5</span></h2><h3 id=premiered-on-january-15-2006>Premiered on January 15, 2006</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/24-day-5.jpg><p>On the day when President Charles Logan and Russian President Yuri Suvarov (<strong>Nick Jameson</strong>) are set to sign an anti-terrorism treaty, Russian separatists execute a plan to stop the historic day.

The season also saw a long-time minor character, Secret Service Agent Aaron Pierce (<strong>Glenn Morshower</strong>), receive an expanded role as he allied with Jack Bauer to take down President Logan. The season finale was the only one in the series to feature no deaths across the 10 days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Watch on Hulu</a></span></p><p><span class=next-single>KEEP READING: <a href=#>Every 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Season, Ranked by Rotten Tomatoes</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51kf3V5xK%2Bcq7FdqLKiv86nZKuZnqCypXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
