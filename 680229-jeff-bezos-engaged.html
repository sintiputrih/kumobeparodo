TMZ has confirmed that Jeff Bezos and girlfriend Lauren Sanchez are engaged. The billionaire proposed to Sanchez while they were enjoying a luxurious voyage around Europe on his impressive $500 million superyacht. It comes as no surprise that Sanchez said "Yes" to Bezos' proposal. The couple <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">has been inseparable</a> since they began dating in 2019. Their relationship began shortly after Bezos' divorce from his wife of 24 years, MacKenzie.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Bezos seems to have spared no expense on the engagement ring, which was proudly displayed by Sanchez aboard the yacht. The size of the rock on her finger is truly impressive. The cost of the engagement ring would be significant to most people. However, it is merely a small portion of Bezos' vast fortune as the founder of Amazon. Interestingly, it appears that the engagement actually took place last week. Sanchez was spotted wearing a ring on her finger in a photograph from Wednesday. At the time, however, the large gemstone was cleverly hidden on the inside of her hand.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bezos-wants-to-give-away-most-of-his-wealth>Bezos Wants To Give Away Most Of His Wealth</h2></span><p>Ginevra Elkann, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez attend the Vanity Fair x Prada Party at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc.(Photo by Victor Boyko/Getty Images for Vanity Fair)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jeff Bezos may be one of the richest people on earth, but he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">doesn't intend for things to stay that way</a>. In fact, he plans to donate most of his wealth during his lifetime. According to reports, the Amazon founder's net worth is estimated to be between $121 billion and $124 billion. In an interview with CNN's Chloe Melas at his residence in Washington, DC, Bezos expressed his intention to utilize his wealth in the fight against climate change and to aid individuals who can contribute to the unification of humanity. However, Bezos did not disclose a specific percentage or provide concrete details regarding the manner in which he plans to distribute his funds. That doesn't mean he plans to stop making money, of course.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For quite some time, there were rumors connecting Jeff Bezosto the potential purchase of the Commanders. He is the third-wealthiest individual globally and a resident of Washington, D.C. As such, Bezos has been seen as a possible bidder for the team. However, controversy arose when sources alleged that the Synders, the current owners of the team, had prevented Bezos from making a bid. The Synders have denied these claims. However, in mid-April, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Bezos was confirmed to no longer be in the running</a>. Days later, the team was purchased by Josh Harris.
