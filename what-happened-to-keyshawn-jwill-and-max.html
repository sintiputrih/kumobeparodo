It covered the sports news of the day with both opinion and analysis. On paper, it seemed like a match made in heaven.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>It didn‚Äôt hurt that they had more than a million followers on Twitter. However, the network <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wanted something new</a>, and the ratings weren‚Äôt mind-blowing, and ESPN New York replaced it with the DiPietro & Rothenberg morning show.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What happened to ‚ÄòKeyshawn, JWill, and Max?‚Äô</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>ESPN let go of Suzy Kolber, Steve Young, Max Kellerman, Keyshawn Johnson, Jeff Van Gundy, Jalen Rose, Todd McShay, Matt Hasselbeck, Ashley Brewer, Joon Lee, LaPhonso Ellis.</p><p>There are about 10 more expected to be let go today <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/y09JMxPyIq</a></p>‚Äî SAY CHEESE! üëÑüßÄ (@SaycheeseDGTL) <a href=#>June 30, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>The show was cancelled in June, a few weeks before Keyshawn and Max were fired. The dismissals were a part of Disney‚Äôs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three rounds of layoffs</a>, where more than 20 top reporters and analysts were let go.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>Initially, those layoffs were not supposed to affect on-air personalities, which obviously turned out to be untrue. The full number of layoffs needed was 7,000. That‚Äôs a lot of sports people.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Kellerman used to be a hot property at the company. He was an integral part of First Take until Stephen A. Smith decided to change up the format of the show.
