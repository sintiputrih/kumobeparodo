In season 4, Cal’s identity is explored even fuller in a moving and dramatic arc that will no doubt speak to plenty of Netflix viewers. Especially as we know the storyline was developed with the help of an authentic voice, someone who is sadly no longer with us.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Season 4, episode 5 ends with a dedication to Shay Patten-Walker, a name that might not be familiar to Sex Education fans although it’s understood that they had a significant impact on the development of the character of Cal and presumably the season’s trans characters, Abbi (Anthony Lexa) and Roman (Felix Mufti). Patten-Walker, who used they/them pronouns, was a trans activist who sadly passed away back in Feb. 2022 after taking their own life. They were 24.</p><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Although their consulting job on Sex Education was not confirmed ahead of time, Patten-Walker shared in one of their final Instagram posts that they had recently served as a “a writers consult for a show I love.” Their friend and colleague at UK Black Pride, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rico Jacob Chace</a>, also confirmed this show was a Netflix production in a memorial post following Patten-Walker’s death. “I only learned at their memorial service that they worked with Netflix to create diversity on the screen,” Chace wrote, “the humility on that one.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Shay's Corner (@notsosecretlyshay)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>A graduate of the University of Greenwich, Patten-Walker gained appreciation for their tireless work as a freelance speaker and facilitator for such LGBTQIA+ organizations and forums as the aforementioned UK Black Pride, Gendered Intelligence, and the 2021 Generation Equality Forum. They also made their voice acting debut playing a Black non-binary character in an unknown video game.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>Shay Patten-Walker’s personality and impact on the community can be best summed up by those who knew them. As Chace wrote:</p><p>“Shay was one of the pillars in the Trans/NB community. They knew everyone, loved everyone and supported everyone. Even at the age of 24, they were a youth worker, poet, public speaker and activist. They used their voice to inspire, educate and empower, creating positive change and uplifting the community… We love you Shay, and I’m glad you’ve found peace. Your light will never be forgotten.”</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>Sex Education season 4, an imperfect end to the show which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nevertheless has its heart very much in the right place</a>, is streaming on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlo52uunnPmqutnZ5ixKK4yp6pZquVrXqmsNScmK2hn6N6tLHArKanZWRisaawyJyYraGfo3qmxM%2BlmKKmlZl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
