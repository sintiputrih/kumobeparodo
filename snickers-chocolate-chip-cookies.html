This can prove to be a temptation for me!</p><p>When all of my kids were really young, I started a tradition of making Halloween Snickers Candy Bar cookies a few days after Halloween. It was the perfect way to use up our Halloween candy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Snickers-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-2-scaled.jpg><p>I found that when you add chopped up Snickers Bars to chocolate chip cookie dough, you get something magical. You end up with an ooey-gooey chocolate caramel peanut cookie that has the perfect balance of sweet and salty.</p><p>Since I have made a fair share of cookies in my days, I have learned some tips and tricks to make sure they turn out every single time. It is much easier working with chocolate chips since they generally keep their shape. However, when you are working with a caramel peanut filled chocolate candy bar, it has a tendency to wander. But don’t you worry — I have a solution!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Snickers-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-11-scaled.jpg><p><h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center block-tip__title has-x-large-font-size">Baking Tips:</h2></p><p>First of all,<strong> use light-colored baking sheets</strong>, if at all possible. I have so many of you write to me saying the bottoms of your cookies are burning. Some of that could be a result of your dark-colored baking sheets. The dark color attracts the heat and the bottoms burn more easily. The solution is to use baking sheets like</p><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0049C2S32 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong>these ones found on Amazon</strong></a><p>. (As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Thank you!)</p><p>The second tip would be to <strong>place the chunks of Snickers Bars in the center of the cookie dough</strong>. This helps to keep the caramel from spreading on the sides. I prefer to manually place the Snickers Bars into the cookie dough after I place them onto the baking sheet. This also helps to evenly disperse the Snickers Bars throughout the cookie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Snickers-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-3-scaled.jpg><p>Another tip would be to use</p><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0161UTDM8 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><strong>parchment paper sheets</strong></a><p>&nbsp;or a Silpat. This helps to ensure that if the caramel spreads it won’t stick to the pan. If it spreads or sticks to the pan, it is still all good. You just need a metal turner to remove the cookies from the cookie sheet.</p><p>I prefer to use a combination of chocolate chips and the Snickers Bars to make sure you are getting chocolate in every bite. If you prefer to only use Snickers Bars, that works too! You can’t go wrong. I would just suggest doubling the amount of Snickers Bars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Snickers-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-4-scaled.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make the Best Snickers Chocolate Chip Cookies:</h2><li><strong>Start by creaming the butter and sugars together</strong>. This is an important step as it helps to create a smooth texture and give the cookies some loft. I suggest creaming for about 4 minutes or until the mixture is light and fluffy and a pale yellow color.</li><li><strong>Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well</strong>. This is the time where you can beat the mixture. Once you add the flour, you want to only gently fold.</li><li><strong>When it is time to add the flour, only mix just until it is combined</strong>. The key is to not activate too much gluten, as that will create a tough texture. That is one of the many reasons why it is a great idea to let your cookie dough chill. It gives the gluten fibers time to relax.</li><li><strong>Slice the Snickers Bars into pieces</strong>. Place the chunks of Snickers Bars in the center of the cookie dough. This helps to keep the caramel from spreading on the sides and helps to evenly disperse the Snickers Bars throughout the cookie.</li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>My favorite Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipes:</h3><p>If you love Chocolate Coconut Pecan Cookies, check out my <strong><a href=#>Cowboy Cookies</a></strong> Recipe.</p><p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cookie Recipes:</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Snickers-Candy-Bar-Chocolate-Chip-Cookie-Recipe.png><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=18669 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/snickers-chocolate-chip-cookies/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=12><li id=wprm-recipe-18686-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=4><p><span>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Let cool for at least 10-15 minutes before removing from the baking sheet. When removing from the oven, you can always carefully add a few more Snickers Bars chunks on the top of the cookie.</span></p></li></ul><p class=has-small-font-size>Nutrition information is automatically calculated, so should only be used as an approximation.</p><span class=cp-load-after-post></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvDnqmnoJ%2Bjsrp6wqikaKuenrCssdGsZJygn5i8ra3TnmScoJmleqS7zqSgnqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
