Two men were shot in the back of the head and a third received a shotgun blast to the chest that knocked him straight off of his chair and onto the ground. Surprisingly, the blast didn't dislodge his signature cigar from his mouth, and he lay on the ground dead with it still firmly between his teeth.</p><p>Two other men sat at the same table, but were left unharmed. The masked men then sprinted off out the back door.</p><p>The man who was shot in the chest was once known as "the boss of all bosses," Carmine Galante, the leader of the Bonanno crime family. He was known to most by his nickname, "Lilo," Italian slang for "cigar," because he was never seen without one in his mouth. One of the most feared Mafiosi in New York, this was a man who once said, "No one will ever kill me, they wouldn't dare."</p><p>The two other dead men were Galante's associate, Leonard Coppola, as well as the owner of the restaurant and Galante's cousin, Giuseppe Turano.</p><p>The two men at the table that were left untouched were the young soldiers in the Bonanno organization that had set Galante up. The killers were also from the Bonanno family, part of a faction led by capo Al Indelicato that sought to kill their boss.</p><p>The other Mafia families had become enraged with Galante's brazen power grabs and blatant disrespect. He had amassed a large, highly profitable heroin operation and refused to share his profits with the other families. Finally, the Mafia Commission, the highest rungs of Mafia leadership, ordered a hit on him, and used his own men to do it.</p><p>The Galante hit is just one of many like it, yet one more tale of greed, betrayal, violence, and death.</p><p>See more of history's most infamous mob hits in the gallery above.</p><p>After this look at mob hits of decades past, learn about the most <a href=#>brutal gangs</a> around the world.
