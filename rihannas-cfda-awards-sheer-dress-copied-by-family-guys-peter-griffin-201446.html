On Tuesday, June 3, TBS tweeted a picture of the beloved cartoon dad wearing an animated version of the same dress (nipples out and all!). &nbsp;</p><p>The fashion face-off started on Monday, June 2, when the 26-year-old singer attended the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards in NYC <a href=#>wearing</a> a sheer, glitzy gown that exposed her nipples and butt. Receiving the 2014 Fashion Icon award at the ceremony, the chanteuse accessorized her custom Adam Selman creation with a glittery head wrap and a strategically placed fur scarf.&nbsp;</p><p>With social media still buzzing about her outrageous look the next day, TBS got in on the fun by posting the hilarious image of Peter Griffin to its Twitter page.&nbsp;</p><p>"That awkward moment when you and your bestie are wearing the same thing. #OneOfUsNeedsToChange," says the TV network's tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>The pop star wasn't fazed by the sartorial theft. Instead, she showed her sense of humor by <a href=#>posting</a> a side-by-side of herself and the cartoon dad on her own Twitter, with the caption "He gets it!"&nbsp;</p><p>(Ri's tweet references an earlier tweet in which she was seemingly poking fun at a fan who attended &nbsp;her prom wearing a version of a jumpsuit Rihanna wore in 2010. The singer <a href=#>wrote</a> "she gets it" on a pic comparing the no-longer-fan to the Wu-Tang Clan's "W" logo.)&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To top it off, the image of Peter Griffin wearing her dress is currently Rihanna's Twitter avatarâ€”perhaps as a jab to the controversy her nipples have stirred on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>The musician deleted her Instagram account in May after she ignited controversy with the photo-sharing company by posting the <a href=#>nipple-baring photos</a> from her spread in French publication Lui magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell Us! Who wore it best: Rihanna or Peter Griffin?&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroZiWu6%2Bt0maan5yRYq64rdGdqmarmJqys3nDq5ysq12YvLG1xJ1km7Fdm66utcuyZKCtqah6sbHTnqlmn6Kes6e1zWZpaWlkaYNw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
