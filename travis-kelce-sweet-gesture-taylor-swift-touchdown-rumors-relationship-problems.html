Critics said the NFL stars were made in poor taste, and didn’t age well considering he started dating Taylor shortly after.</p><p>“To all the breeders out there,” Travis said in the podcast. “I’m gonna find a breeder, and I’m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.”</p><p>There’s also been controversy surrounding Travis’ ex-girlfriend Maya Benberry, who made a public warning to Taylor Swift in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Daily Mail</a> last year. She not only claimed Travis has a history of cheating but said Taylor should be leery of his intentions. Travis and Taylor never publicly responded to Maya’s comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lo6yypsCMoJysrKWnsm7AwLKjqKpdqMSqstNmq6itk52xsMPNZqmupZ%2BnwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mp6unkqGyrr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
