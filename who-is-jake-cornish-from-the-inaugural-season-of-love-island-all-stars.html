Mike Spencer, the creative director of&nbsp;the Love Island&nbsp;franchise, gave an overview of the soon-to-be hit show in a statement, explaining what exactly Love Island: All Stars will entail.</p><p>“It has been rumored now for a while, but we are thrilled to finally confirm that we are making Love Island: All Stars early next year for ITV2 and ITVX. It’s set to be a must watch series seeing some of your favorite islanders from across the years heading back to the stunning South African villa to once again ‘graft’ as their search for love continues. I simply can’t wait!”</p><p data-characters=454 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>After wronging the one and only Liberty Poole during Love Island: UK season 7, Cornish became one of the most well-known islanders in the history of the Love Island franchise (and not for a good reason). Sharing the villa with Poole herself during the inaugural season of Love Island: All Stars is sure to cause quite a bit of quarrels, but for those who need a refresher on Cornish’s controversial behavior back in 2021, just keep scrolling…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Island (@loveisland)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>For those who are unfamiliar with what went down between Poole and Cornish during Love Island: UK season 7, their relationship seemed to be smooth sailing until the infamous Movie Night, where Cornish said some controversial things that caused Poole to question both his feelings and his intentions.</p><p>“It’s just not that 100 percent… I haven’t got the girl there where I’m like f*** me I want to rip your clothes off. I don’t want to fake any s*** you know what I mean? I don’t want to say I really do like her when I don’t. I’d be lying to myself.”</p><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Naturally, these nasty comments resulted in their split, with both Poole and Cornish leaving the villa just three days shy of finale night, however, the latter does not seem to have any regrets. Ahead of the premiere of Love Island: All Stars, Cornish even admitted that he does not plan to change his behavior his second time around — yikes!</p><p>“There is nothing major I would do differently, but I have definitely matured in the two years since first being on the show. I look at things differently and respond differently. When it comes to people’s opinions, I don’t sit on the fence anymore. That is my way of life now, so I will take that into the villa.”</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Nonetheless, Cornish plans to put his past behind him on Love Island: All Stars and keep his sights set on just one thing: Love. Admitting that he has a keen interest in Molly Smith from Love Island: UK season 6, our fingers are crossed that this British beauty eventually enters the soon-to-be hit show as a bombshell (for Cornish’s sake).</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Despite saying that there is no bad blood between him and Poole, we cannot wait to see the pair interact with one another during the inaugural season of Love Island: All Stars. To catch the highly-anticipated premiere for yourself, be sure to tune into ITV2 on January 15 — you seriously will not regret it…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlmpa4pnnCqKmnoaOdeqe%2BzqZkraCVYravrdSgrKuZnGLApq3SqKVmp5ZiubDCxGagrKSRo7FurculZKyskafAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
