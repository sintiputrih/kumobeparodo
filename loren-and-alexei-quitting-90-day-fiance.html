"Well, I'm not having any more babies to stay on 90 Day Fiancé."</p><p>Alexei agreed to no more children joining the family, adding, "I don't know, I guess as long as they want, but I never imagined it will be still here ten years after, shooting Happily Ever After?"</p><p>The doting mom told the outlet that they try not to get "caught up" with being on TV, especially as they don't want it to affect their relationship or their children's lives.</p><p>"I don't think we still understand it," she admitted. "Like, people come up to us and they're like, 'Can we say hi?' We're like, 'Yes, of course.' Like, we are so normal."</p><p>They seem to be in it for the long haul, but they also want to live normal lives.</p><p>On X, fans have shared their thoughts on Loren and Alexei, claiming they are "one of the few normal couples," but do not add any real drama to the show.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is cute and all but Loren and Alexei are clearly a last minute thing to cover for Michael and Angela.
