In fact, YouTuber turned boxer Jake Paul recently channeled his inner Will Smith while defending his dog.</p><p><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Paul</a> was a guest at an episode of the ‘<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Impaulsive</a>‘ podcast hosted by his brother, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Logan Paul</a>. Moreover, the podcast was co-hosted by Mike Majlak and George Janko. In conversation, Paul was having a hilarious tirade about his hatred for the animal rights organization, PETA. However, he also added that he was completely against the idea of using animal fur.</p><p>Meanwhile, Majlak asked him about his stance on fur, saying, “Are you sure you don’t have a fur coat because I saw your dog come into the gym today? With its entire coat shaved off.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1313062926.jpg><p>In response, Paul joked that his dog suffered from alopecia. However, when Majlak proded further, he defended his dog by referencing Smith. He said, “Yo, don’t talk about my f*cking dog like that. Yo, I’m gonna slap you. Will Smith the f*ck.”</p><p>It is also worth noting that Paul’s dog does not actually have alopecia, and he was only joking about the same.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>What was the incident that Jake Paul was referencing?</h2><p>Jake Paul was referencing the now infamous incident that took place at the 94th Academy Awards on March 27, 2022. Comedian Chris Rock was performing a comedic monologue which he was reading from a teleprompter.</p><p>Meanwhile, Smith and his wife were present in the audience. Incidentally, Jada Pinkett Smith was also sporting a shaved head. Notably, Smith shaved her head following her struggle with <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>alopecia</a>. As a part of his act, Rock told her, ” Jada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2, can’t wait to see it, alright?”</p><p>In fact, he was referring to Demi Moore’s character in GI Jane, who also sported a buzzed hairdo. This was when Will Smith, seemingly offended at the statement, walked on stage and smacked Rock across the face, asking him to keep his wife’s name out of his mouth.</p><p>The film fraternity and fans were left shocked by the turn of events. Moreover, Smith later apologized for his actions.</p><p><strong>WATCH THIS STORY – <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Top 5 Fights on Which Boxing Fans Would Pay Anything to Watch: Fury vs Joshua, Canelo vs Ward, and More</a></strong></p><p>What do you think of Paul’s Smith reference?
