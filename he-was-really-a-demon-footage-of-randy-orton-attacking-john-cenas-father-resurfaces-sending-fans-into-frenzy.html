Perhaps one of the most memorable moments that sparked a personal vendetta between the two was Randy Orton attacking <a href=#>John Cena</a>‘s father.</p><p><a href=#>Randy Orton</a>‘s career evolution is one of the more fascinating stories in the wrestling industry. Randy Orton, once known as the brash and up-and-coming superstar with the potential to reach the next level of stardom, gradually morphed into a sadistic sociopath during the late 2000s.</p><p><a href=#>Randy Orton</a>‘s feud with John Cena in 2007 marked a turning point in his character, as he became even more violent than before. That says a lot, considering Randy Orton always had violent tendencies, even when he was the cocky “Legend Killer” persona in his early years in the company.</p><p>Randy Orton is as vicious as they come, and he will go after anyone for his own gain, including loved ones. He’s brutally assaulted fathers like Dusty Rhodes and Paul Bearer, even locking Paul Bearer in a meat freezer.&nbsp;</p><p>The night after the Summerslam 2007 PPV, John Cena faced King Booker in the show’s main event match on an August 2007 episode of Monday Night Raw. Before the fight could end, Randy Orton and King Booker launched an assault on John Cena, viciously beating him down.</p><p>King Booker walked away, leaving Randy Orton alone in the ring with a battered John Cena, as it appeared Randy Orton was about to punt John Cena’s head off and send him to the hospital. Randy Orton stopped himself from kicking John Cena in the head as he got into position for his signature punting move, revealing he had other plans.</p><p>Randy Orton rushed outside the ring and grabbed John Cena’s father, John Cena Sr, who was sitting in the front row. Randy Orton threw John Cena Sr to the floor at ringside and delivered a vicious kick to the head, knocking him unconscious with such force.</p><p>Randy Orton’s plan to get inside John Cena’s head was to kick his father in the head, as such an evil act is arguably the most personal occurrence in their rivalry.</p><p>A user recently tweeted a video of Randy Orton attacking John Cena’s father. Fans went crazy remembering the legendary rivalry and sharing their thoughts on The Viper persona.</p><p>https://twitter.com/Flawlesslikekas/status/1587948853239635969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1587948853239635969%7Ctwgr%5Ee72aa346ee3ddc5811162efcc864788e387028c5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.essentiallysports.com%2Fwwe-news-the-villain-of-villains-fans-become-nostalgic-as-randy-orton-attacks-john-cenas-father-in-resurfaced-video%2F</p><p>https://twitter.com/CloudStrife2021/status/1587949502555918336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1587949502555918336%7Ctwgr%5Ee72aa346ee3ddc5811162efcc864788e387028c5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.essentiallysports.com%2Fwwe-news-the-villain-of-villains-fans-become-nostalgic-as-randy-orton-attacks-john-cenas-father-in-resurfaced-video%2F</p><p>https://twitter.com/kingjjj177/status/1588003888564666368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1588003888564666368%7Ctwgr%5Ee72aa346ee3ddc5811162efcc864788e387028c5%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.essentiallysports.com%2Fwwe-news-the-villain-of-villains-fans-become-nostalgic-as-randy-orton-attacks-john-cenas-father-in-resurfaced-video%2F</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Randy orton was really a demon</p><p>— Don Korleon ♒️ (@Kingpin_Koleey) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 2, 2022</a></p><p>As expected, Randy Orton and John Cena’s feud continued after Unforgiven 2007, with Randy Orton triumphing by injuring him and winning the WWE Championship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmoZ1drK60edGemKWkqWKubrDEpqanZZakvLWtxp5kqJ5dp66vsNhmpqusn6N6osDTmpqkoZ6cequ7x6dknJ2elsBussCtn56qXaeytMHRn5icnaNiwKa6w6KloGWWlru0ecinq6hllqeyr8bYaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
