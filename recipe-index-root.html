It sounds silly, I know, but partway through last winter, I ended up with jars and jars of different nuts in the cupboard. Pistachios left from this carrot salad, hazelnuts left from this kohlrabi slaw, and so forth. I had one big canister of almonds that was begging to be eaten, and since Jack and I had a great time making homemade peanut butter last spring, I decided to try blending them into homemade almond butter. Let me tell you, I am so glad…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>On a cool spring morning, nothing gets me out of bed like the thought of these strawberry muffins. To me, they’re the perfect balance of cozy and refreshing. Cozy because they’re moist, fluffy, and warmly spiced with cinnamon. And refreshing because they’re packed to the brim with fresh fruit. I love savoring one for breakfast with a cup of coffee or tea and grabbing another in the afternoon for a sweet, yet still wholesome, snack. Oh! And if you’re looking for a last-minute addition to your Mother’s Day menu this weekend, these strawberry muffins would be great for that too.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There’s rarely a week that goes by without me making poached eggs. In fact, “Put a poached egg on it,” is one of my tried-and-true mottos. If I’m making toast, a salad, or a grain bowl, and it just needs a little extra something (e.g., protein), I pop a poached egg on top. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner = solved. Poached eggs might seem fancy, but they’re actually really simple to make at home. My method for how to poach an egg takes minutes, uses basic equipment, and requires 3 ingredients. Better yet, the eggs always come out with firm, yet…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>How CUTE are these pickled eggs?! They’re my new spring obsession, a grown-up substitute for the Easter eggs I dyed with my family as a kid. Back then, I colored my eggs with little bottles of food coloring, but in this pickled eggs recipe, I use natural ingredients instead. Red beets turn the eggs pink and purple, and a mix of yellow beets and turmeric creates that sunny yellow. I love keeping a jar of these pickled eggs on hand in the fridge for healthy, protein-packed snacking (though they’d be a fantastic addition to a spring brunch spread, too!). They’re…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>As I sat down to write this post, I remembered that I have a stash of these carrot cake cookies in the freezer. Just like carrot cake, they’re soft, moist, and filled with warm, spiced flavor. Walnuts or pecans add nutty crunch, and a tangy cream cheese frosting takes them over the top. Right now, I’m using all my willpower to resist running down the kitchen and devouring one on the spot. But no! I want to tell you all about these carrot cake cookies first. They’re the perfect spring treat – wholesome enough for an afternoon snack, brunch, or…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This kale smoothie recipe is such an energizing way to start the day! Now that the weather’s warming up in Chicago, it’s made its way into my breakfast rotation of freezer burritos, muffins, and avocado toast. Refreshing and nutritious, it’s what I crave on mornings when the sun is shining, the air smells sweet, and it really feels like spring is on its way. The magic of this kale smoothie recipe is that it doesn’t actually taste like kale. Don’t get me wrong, kale’s flavor has its time and place. It’s irresistible in a kale salad or pasta, but in…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Can you imagine getting out of bed in the morning, knowing that a vegan breakfast burrito is already waiting for you in the kitchen? You don’t have to do a ton of prep or clean up. Heck, you don’t really have to do anything except for popping it in the microwave and eating it. Does that sound idyllic or what? Well, my friend, I have good news for you. This vegan breakfast burrito freezes perfectly, so you can a prep stash in advance and keep them on hand for busy mornings. They’re healthy, flavorful, and packed with plant-based protein. Served…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I was growing up, I ate chocolate chip muffins for breakfast nearly every morning. They were one of my mom’s specialties – moist, tender, and lightly sweet. Served warm, with a cold glass of milk to drink, they were an unbeatable way to start the day. These days, I prefer coffee or tea to milk, but I still savor a chocolate chip muffin whenever I get the chance. Lately, “whenever I get the chance” has been pretty much all the time, because I’ve been baking this chocolate chip muffin recipe on repeat. If you also happen to love chocolate…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I make this healthy banana bread recipe, I lose all control. Just knowing that a loaf is sitting in the kitchen keeps me coming back for just one more slice all day long. I slather it with peanut butter and enjoy it for breakfast, pair it with a cup of coffee for an afternoon snack, and snag another piece (or two) for dessert. It’s moist, lightly sweet, and filled with rich banana flavor. As an added bonus, it makes the house smell like vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg while it bakes. I mean, seriously. What’s not to love? If you…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>So often, I hear from readers who are looking for vegan breakfast ideas. It makes sense – for many of us, eggs and yogurt are pretty standard breakfast fare. What other options are out there? Well, good news! Many traditional breakfast recipes like oatmeal and smoothies are naturally vegan, and others, such as pancakes and muffins, can be made vegan with a few easy ingredient swaps. Below, you’ll find classic vegan breakfast recipes like these as well as out-of-the-box ideas that you might not have tried before. They’re all fresh, flavorful, and energizing – a perfect way to start the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love starting my day with a protein-packed breakfast like this tofu scramble! It’s energizing, flavorful, and satisfying, the sort of thing that’s guaranteed to keep me full till lunch. I think you’ll love this recipe if you’re vegan – it’s quick and easy, it’s high in protein, and it’s a great savory option given how many vegan breakfast recipes are sweet. But even if you’re not vegan, I hope you’ll give it a try. Thanks to spices, nutritional yeast, and a dash of Dijon mustard, this tofu scramble recipe is packed with flavor.
