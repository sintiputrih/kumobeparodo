That question becomes even tougher around the holidays when gifts are necessary. That’s why we’ve rounded up some great video game-related items that would make great stocking stuffers this holiday season. Every item on this list is under $70 too, so you won’t have to deal with the exorbitant prices surrounding some gaming hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Steam Deck. Any gamer in your life should enjoy these seven gaming-themed items.</p><h2>DualSense Charging Station: $30</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>Have a gamer with a PS5 in your life? They probably have multiple DualSense controllers that don’t have the best battery life. Constantly taking up a USB slot on one’s PS5 with a charging cable is annoying, so any PS5 owners will appreciate <span data-cloudcity=1 data-pid=0cR4QJlQyK data-type=textlink id=dtcc-0cR4QJlQyK class=dtcc-affiliate--textlink>a charging station</span> where they can place their controller to ensure they are ready the next time they want to game. Sony’s official charging station is fairly cheap at $30, but there are lots of similar DualSense Charging Stations you can find from third-party companies that will accomplish the same thing for a similar price.</p><h2>Xbox, Switch, or PlayStation gift cards: $10 to $70</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you’re not exactly sure what video game to get the gamer you’re shopping for, you can always go the classic route and just give them money to spend on their console of choice. Xbox, PlayStation, and the Nintendo Switch each have readily available gift cards and digital codes for purchase, with each starting at $10 and going up to $70, depending on the console. You can easily find the cards at most stores, and the digital codes can be found through a quick Amazon search.</p><h2>Xbox Live Gold, Switch Online, or PlayStation Plus card: $8 to $60</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Xbox Live, Nintendo Switch Online, and PlayStation Plus are all subscription services that give special perks to subscribers. Those perks include being able to play games online, having access to special free games, getting special marketplace deals, and more. That’s why a gift card for these services is a great idea for a stocking stuffer. The price will vary based on how long you want to gift the service to them but starts at $8 for one month of Nintendo Online and $10 for one month of PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold. The highest is $20 for a year of Nintendo Online and $60 for a year of Xbox Live Gold and PlayStation Plus. You can find a digital code card easily on Amazon for each of these products.</p><h2>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: $15</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service that allows Xbox and PC players to select from a <a href=#>huge variety of games</a> and play them to their heart’s content. The service has been the talk of the gaming world for a long time, and for a good reason. It gives any player instant access to tons of quality games for a monthly fee. Amazon stocks a one-month card for the service for $15 and a three-month card for $38. The service is accessible from Xbox One, <a href=# data-injected=1>Xbox Series X</a>/S, PC, and even mobile devices and web browsers thanks to Xbox Cloud Gaming technology. For a stocking stuffer, even just one month of Xbox Game Pass is the best bang for your buck on this list.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch memory card: starts at $15</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Nintendo Switch is a great system with an amazing <a href=#>library of games</a> that’s constantly expanding. Unfortunately, the console isn’t optimized to download too many games at once due to its 32 GB memory size. That’s why you may want to look into getting your Switch owner <span data-cloudcity=1 data-pid=vcztLxbcEA data-type=textlink id=dtcc-vcztLxbcEA class=dtcc-affiliate--textlink>a SanDisk microSD card</span>. These cards increase the console’s memory and allow for increased playability of more games without having to constantly manage memory. They start at $15 for the smallest size at 64GB and rise in price as the size increases. You can find them on Amazon.</p><h2>An 8BitDo controller: $20 to $50</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If what your gamer is looking for is a good all-purpose controller, then check out <span data-cloudcity=1 data-pid=rEe6shDPoT data-type=textlink id=dtcc-rEe6shDPoT class=dtcc-affiliate--textlink>8BitDo’s controller</span> line. This controller company has been releasing the gold standard of third-party controllers for all platforms for years now, and are easy to find on Amazon. Their controllers come in all shapes and sizes, from more retro-styled paddles to modern pads, <a href=#>mini controllers</a>, and retro-modern hybrids.</p><h2>Pokemon Legends: Arceus Nintendo Switch Split Pad Pro: $58</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Has the gamer in your life been enjoying <a href=#>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>&nbsp;throughout the year? If so, you’ll want to get them the Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ themed Switch Split Pad Pro by HORI. This themed controller not only looks cool with its inkbrush link drawings and image of Arceus but also provides a nice, sturdier alternative to the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons that will <a href=#>inevitably start to drift</a>. The controller’s unique design makes it more comfortable than a standard Joy-Con too.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfnK6utc2gZpudo6l6tMDOnKKippdiwLXBxZ%2Bcq6tdnK6usdGsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
