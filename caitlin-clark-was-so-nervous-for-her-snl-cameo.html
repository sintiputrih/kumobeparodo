But it was a good little skit. It was fun to be a part of. Hopefully I can go back and do it again sometime.”</p><p>During the press conference, Clark recalled the whirlwind experience of flying to New York City for the show in one day.</p><p>“I actually flew from L.A. to New York and I went right to the set,” she told reporters. “Obviously the show doesn’t start until 11:30, so I was just, like, chugging coke all night trying to stay awake. Coffee, soda. It was fun. They just kind of throw you into the fire.”</p><p>Appearing alongside <strong>Michael Che</strong> and <strong>Colin Jost</strong> during the “Weekend Update” segment of the Saturday, April 13, <a href=#>episode of Saturday Night Live</a>, Clark gave Che, 40, some jokes to read aloud. Che has historically poked fun at women’s sports during the segment, and Clark was brought in to set him straight.</p><p>“The Indiana Fever has the first pick in this Monday’s WNBA Draft,” he said, reading the first joke. “A reminder that Indiana Fever is a WNBA team and not what Michael Che gave to dozens of women at Purdue University.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Caitlin-Clark-Was-So-Nervous-For-Her-Saturday-Night-Live-Cameo.jpg><p>Clark playfully admitted that she didn’t actually write the jokes for the skit, but she was grateful to be part of a special episode of the iconic series.</p><p>“It was a good platform for women’s sports, everybody loved it,” she recalled on Wednesday. “And that was a great show. <strong>Emily Blunt</strong>, <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong>, <strong>Chris Stapleton</strong>, <strong>Kate McKinnon</strong>. So many amazing people that came back.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Just two days after her SNL debut, Clark was selected by the Indiana Fever as the No. 1 pick in the <a href=#>WNBA draft</a> on Monday, April 15, following her record-breaking senior season with the Iowa Hawkeyes. Her crowd-pleasing cameo on SNL had its comedic elements, but Clark made sure to use the platform to thank her role models for helping her get to the WNBA.</p><p>The segment ended earnestly, with Che wishing Clark the best of luck: “Good luck in the WNBA. I hope you have a great first season.” Clark then addressed the camera with her heartfelt thanks to her basketball heroes.</p><p>“It’s just one step for the WNBA. Thanks to all the great players like <strong>Sheryl Swoopes</strong>, <strong>Lisa Leslie</strong>, <strong>Cynthia Cooper</strong>, the great <strong>Dawn Staley</strong> and my basketball hero, <strong>Maya Moore</strong>,” Clark said. “These are the women that kicked down the door so I could walk inside. I want to thank them tonight for laying the foundation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqaoaShtq95wqWYq6NdrK60edKoZKedoqu8tr%2BMn6arZZiav26%2FzaVknJmdmrxw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
