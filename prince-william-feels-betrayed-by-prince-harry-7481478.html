According to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>The Telegraph</a>, Harry and his father, King Charles, engaged in "peace talks" before the Duke of Sussex made his decision to attend the coronation without his wife and children. However, the same sources explain that Harry and William still haven't had a heart-to-heart and that William didn't want anything to do with those chats with good ol' pops.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sources note that Harry and Charles's conversations were "positive" but William continues to feel betrayed by Harry's memoir,&nbsp;Spare.&nbsp;During all of the is-he-or-isn't-he-coming speculation, Harry spent "several weeks agonizing" over his decision, but a source adds, “It is about showing up, showing support and being there for his father. It was a very personal decision, not a PR one.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like William, the other members of the royal family seem to be content icing Harry out. Sources shared with the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a>&nbsp;that other royals have "no interest" in speaking to Harry beyond "the most basic of greetings," and that William specifically has "no plans to speak to him." It shouldn't be difficult for Harry to make an appearance and quickly head home, as he isn't scheduled to attend most of the ancillary events surrounding the coronation.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, it's Archie's fourth birthday the same day, so it wouldn't be a stretch to assume that Harry wants to get back home to California as quickly as possible to attend those festivities.&nbsp;<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z6ugp5uVYsSquMuimKZllpqyrb%2BMm5ytqpGusqV5wbJkqaqZo7CmeceaqauxXWyBeX2TcG8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
