No further information about the newborn has been confirmed at this time.

They got engaged in 2017 and tied the knot in June 2018 in Scotland. Kit and Rose are already parents to a baby boy, who was born in February 2021. They have yet to publicly reveal the toddler’s name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kit-Harington-Rose-Leslie-welcome-baby-no-2-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kit announced</a> news of his and Rose’s second baby during an interview on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon in February. “I’m terrified,” he admitted. “With the first baby you’re, like, walking through clouds and dancing through fields of daisies for nine months. Well, the man is anyway. [With the second baby], the reality check comes much shorter. You get practical real quick.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>At the time of the interview, Kit also shared that his son hadn’t “conceptually understood” that he was getting a sibling just yet. “We’re trying to get him ready for it,” he said. “We point to Rose’s tummy and say, “Mommy’s baby.’ And he points at his tummy and says, ‘My baby.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The announcement was slightly more low-key than the pair’s first pregnancy reveal. In Sept. 2020, Rose confirmed the pregnancy by posing with her baby bump on display for an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Make Magazine</a>. “I can’t wait to meet the new member of our family,” she gushed at the time. She rocked a number of different ensembles for the photo shoot, showing off her growing belly in several of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49sZqShpGK1or7Ip56tp55iv7C%2FxGajnqucnrJursCbsGaan6e7br%2FEnKannF2Ytaq4w2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
