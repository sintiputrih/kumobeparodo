The group is also known for its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-evolution beliefs</a> and views against the Chinese Communist Party.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Falun Gong practitioners exercise at the beach in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2001</p></figure><p>Li has made some controversial statements in the past.
