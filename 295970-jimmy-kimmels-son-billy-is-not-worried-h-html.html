He still needs one open heart surgery, but he's doing great." Kimmel <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jimmy-kimmel-son-billy-5-has-no-interest-learning-about-his-open-heart-surgery/>shared</a> that their son was one of the main reasons the couple attended and supported the charity.</p><p class=dh>Speaking to the reporters at the benefit on Saturday, October 9, Kimmel disclosed that supporting the charity came from a personal place. They had been patrons long before their son came along, oblivious that his own family would one day be beneficiaries of the treatment from the organization.</p><p class=dh>At only five, Billy <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jimmy-kimmel-son-billy-5-has-no-interest-learning-about-his-open-heart-surgery/>carries scars</a> on his chest from his two open heart surgeries, but according to his dad, the little boy wouldn't care less about his scars or his surgeries. Kimmel <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jimmy-kimmel-son-billy-5-has-no-interest-learning-about-his-open-heart-surgery/>told</a> the reporters that Billy had no idea what they were up to on Saturday and did not care a tad about it:</p><p class=dh>"I tried to explain the heart surgery to him because he has a bit of a scar down the center of his chest, and he has almost no interest."</p><p class=dh>While the boy seems fine, his life began on a dramatic note for him and his parents, and it is tear-jerking to see the progress he's made in the five years he's walked the earth.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Billy Had Open-Heart Surgery Only Three Days After His Birth</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Like all parents, Kimmel and McNearney were ecstatic when they found out they would welcome their second baby. And on April 21, 2017, they celebrated the arrival of their little boy, William John, or Billy, as they often refer to him.</p><p class=dh>Sadly, their initial baby bliss was cut short when they learned their son had been born with a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/parents/jimmy-kimmel-reveals-his-newborn-son-had-open-heart-surgery-t111032>heart defect.</a> The condition, known as Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, required Billy to have open heart surgery only three days after his birth.</p><p class=dh>Kimmel shared in detail how they received the disheartening news during an opening monologue to his show "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" But before starting the frightening narration, Kimmel assured the audience that the tale had a happy ending.</p><p class=dh>He then told how his wife had been in bed relaxing after delivering their baby at Cedars-Sinai Hospital. Their closest family members, who had come to meet and celebrate their baby, were in the room. Everything was good, and they were happy, until a nurse, who's been checking out the baby, heard a murmur in Billy's heart.</p><p class=dh>While that is common, what alarmed the attentive nurse was how purple Billy looked, a very uncommon and worrisome trait in a newborn. Kimmel recalls the nurse asking him to walk with her and Billy to the Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)</p><p class=dh>Once they got there, to Kimmel's chagrin, he discovered their new baby had a hole in the wall between the left and right side of his heart that barred him from getting enough oxygen to his blood. The condition would require several surgeries to fix, with his first scheduled only days later.</p><p class=dh>Luckily, Billy's first surgery was successful, and as Kimmel narrated and showed pictures of how his little boy looked at the theatre versus after, he teared up then made light of the moment, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmWWoMcGmo0">saying</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Poor boy, not only did he get a bad heart, [but] he also got my face."</p><p class=dh>The audience burst into a roar of laughter, even as Kimmel assured them that they got to take their boy home only six days after his open heart surgery, adding that he was feeding and sleeping well.</p><p class=dh>At seven months, Billy underwent his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.today.com/health/jimmy-kimmel-takes-tv-break-7-month-old-son-undergoes-t119642>second surgery</a>, and like his first, it was just as successful. On the morning of her son's surgery, McNearney pleaded with other parents in an emotional tweet that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/mollymcnearney/status/937889340012732416>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"If your children are healthy, be thankful. And do something to help those whose children are not."</p><p class=dh>After Billy's second surgery, ABC announced that Kimmel would take a week off from his show to spend time with his family. In the meantime, celebrity Samaritans would handle his hosting duties.</p><p class=dh>Chosen <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/tv-guy/os-et-jimmy-kimmel-melissa-mccarthy-neil-patrick-harris-20171205-story.html>to fill in</a> for Kimmel were "Jurassic World" actor Chris Pratt, who hosted on Monday, and "Black-ish" star Tracee Ellis Ross, who took over on Tuesday. "How I Met Your Mother" actor Neil Patrick Harris filled in on Wednesday, while "The Bridesmaids" actress Melissa McCarthy on Thursday.</p><p class=dh>It has been a tumultuous journey for Kimmel and McNearny raising a son with a life-threatening heart condition. It is no wonder small milestones like celebrating their son's birthday are a huge deal.</p><p class=dh>The chat show host celebrated his son's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CcnZ26cLwzu/>5th birthday</a> in April, paying him a sweet tribute with a heartfelt Instagram post. He posted a photo of Billy in a blue T-shirt smiling at the small cake in front of him decorated with three birthday candles.</p><p class=dh>After wishing his "little nut" an excellent birthday, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/jimmy-kimmel-celebrates-son-billy-5th-birthday/>he thanked</a> the brilliant doctors and nurses for saving Billy's life. Also, he thanked everyone that had donated and held the family in prayers and positive thoughts.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Who Is Billy's Mom, Molly McNearney?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Billy's dad, Kimmel, might be a household name to many who love and watch his show, but his mother, McNearney, may not be so familiar to as many people. But who is she?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/fed88c16de39b2511a3f10dfd0470c01.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Molly McNearney attends the Jimmy Kimmel, Molly McNearney and St. Joseph Center at Winter Wonderland event on December 12, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>McNearny is the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/who-is-molly-mcnearney-jimmy-kimmel-wife/>executive produce</a>r and co-head writer of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" While the two have been partners for nearly a decade, theirs began as a workplace relationship. McNearney says their first meeting was nothing to write home about. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.glamour.com/story/molly-mcnearney-reveals-how-sh>told</a> Glamour:</p><p class=dh>"When I first met him, he insulted me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dc7732bcd4daa12f21321ac289e27248.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Producer Molly McNearney attends ELLE's 6th Annual Women In Television Dinner at Sunset Tower Hotel on January 20, 2016 in West Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>She retold how the show's executive producer had taken her into Kimmel's office, introducing her to him as his new assistant.

What a waste of time."</p><p class=dh>Despite the rough start to their working relationship, the two eventually developed a camaraderie, mainly because they worked closely. However, at the time, they were both involved with other people, and their relationship remained purely non-romantic for the first six years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/bd417760efb7cb9456c7310d463621be.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jimmy Kimmel, and Molly McNearney at the one night only celebration "Norman Lear: 100 Years of Music and Laughter" on September 8 2022 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Eventually, they found themselves single, and since they had grown closer over the years, suddenly, things turned. Kimmel finally won the lady's heart by cooking for her. McNearney told Glamour, as People <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/who-is-molly-mcnearney-jimmy-kimmel-wife/>reports</a>:</p><p class=dh>"All the writers would socialize after the show, and we would just hang out more and more.

McNearney says she loved how the writers, including herself, made fun of Kimmel and was comfortable in how the working relationship thrived.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2ba1f160f8dff361489ceaec7bef8dbe.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Molly McNearney and television host/comedian Jimmy Kimmel at the Wynn Las Vegas on October 29, 2011 in Las Vegas, Nevada | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>She knew dating Kimmel could easily jeopardize that and did not want their work relationship's dynamic to change because of their new dating status. Even so, she decided she would carry on with the romance.</p><p class=dh>When they first started dating, McNearney soon discovered just how thoughtful Kimmel was. She recalls spending time between her house and Kimmel's as she still loved her space. But then, one day, while at his house, she noticed that he had been in the bathroom way too long.</p><p class=dh>She thought maybe he'd taken time to internalize their relationship, but then she had the surprise of her life when he presented her with a big box containing two of everything in her makeup and toiletry bag a few days later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c1a69523f42bc974c1a4c86705c99cca.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jimmy Kimmel, Molly McNearney, and Amy Poehler at Lincoln Center on April 23, 2013 in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>He had noticed her lugging stuff back and forth between her house and his, and he wanted to make her comfortable in his house.

From that, she realized they were just as human as anyone else, and the notion of a celebrity attending her wedding no longer excited her.

His health struggles, as mentioned earlier, were hard on his parents, and his mother struggled to come to terms with his condition.</p><p class=dh>However, Kimmel <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/who-is-molly-mcnearney-jimmy-kimmel-wife/>praised his wife</a> for remaining level-headed, loving, strong, and positive during the "worst nightmare a new mother could experience."</p><p class=dh>So far, Billy has had two successful surgeries to correct his heart condition.
