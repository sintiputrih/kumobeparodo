As a member of New Edition, he has gotten all kinds of awards and 10s of millions of records sold. Once he branched out as a solo act, he created an even bigger name for himself. But that doesn't mean his life has been easy.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If anything could overshadow his success in music, it would be his struggles with drugs, alcohol, domestic violence against his ex-wife and legendary singer the late <a href=#>Whitney Houston</a>, and more. Because of this, he's been in and out of jail over the years. But how long has it been overall?

But from what we do know, could be less than 100 days in total. According to an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Bobby faced a "string of arrests" in the late 90s because of his drug and alcohol abuse. It's not specified exactly how long each stay was or how many arrests there were. Luckily, during a 75-day sentence in 2000 (of which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he only served 39 days</a>), Bobby was able to leave drugs alone. However, this wouldn't be his last arrest.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>In 2000, Bobby also had a 26-day stay in jail because he violated the parole agreement he had on a 1996 drunk driving conviction, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported that when he was arrested in 1996, he spent eight days in jail. He also was arrested on Nov. 7, 1999, for marijuana possession, having no driver's license or proof of insurance, and speeding.

He continued saying that he believes therapy is "good for the soul."</p><p>Although Bobby did leave drugs behind decades ago, he told People that the process of getting sober wasn't easy. He said he was so addicted he had to be put into a medical detox. But after that, his faith got him through it. He got together with other inmates, worshipped, and read the Bible.
