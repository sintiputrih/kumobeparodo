I’ve never been more excited or hopeful for the next decade of my life,” the <a href=#>Boy Meets World</a> alum wrote via Instagram. “I had a beautiful childhood, teenage years I still dream about, my 20s were insane (and mostly miserable) and my 30s brought me lows and highs but eventually, I leveled out to a place of security. Security in who I am, what I believe and with whom I want to spend precious time. I couldn’t be more grateful to enter my 40s with my amazing husband and son, excitedly expecting the arrival of baby boy No. 2.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Danielle-Fishel-Is-Pregnant-With-Her-Jensen-Karp-2nd-Baby-003.jpg><p>In the social media upload, the Arizona native debuted her baby bump in a floral dress. She was all smiles standing on the sidewalk in <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>.</p><p>Karp, 41, gave his Instagram followers another look at his wife’s budding belly with a family photo featuring their 22-month-old son, Adler.</p><p>“Happy 40th birthday to my life partner, a team captain and the greatest mom to our now soon to be two boys,” the comedian captioned the sweet shot. “She believes in our squad and even when I held a newborn Adler like he was a fragile piece of china for the first four months, she had the patience and care of a saint. My heart was made to be here with her and though she should be celebrated every day, today is a milestone occasion. Love you @daniellefishel.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Danielle-Fishel-Is-Pregnant-With-Her-Jensen-Karp-2nd-Baby-001.jpg><p>The couple <a href=#>wed in November 2018</a> in Los Angeles and announced two months later that they were <a href=#>growing their family</a>. Adler <a href=#>arrived in June 2019</a>, one month early.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Once Fishel and Karp were able to bring their baby boy home, <a href=#>his health journey was a “roller-coaster,”</a> the actress exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2019. “We’ve been in and out of Children’s Hospital and doctor’s appointments. He was on a medicated formula because he couldn’t be on breast milk because of the condition that he had … creating the fluid in his lungs. Obviously, there are such great benefits to breast milk, so we keep doing X-rays. The fluid was gone so we were given the go-ahead to put him back on breast milk, and then we did and we went back in for a checkup, the fluid was back in his lungs so we had to take him off of it again.”</p><p>While the Girl Meets World alum called parenting “hit and miss,” she gushed at the time that Adler is a “smiley, happy, wonderful, lovely baby.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadmZ6esq24xGadoquYmrlutdJmp6udl6Our8CMsKCtoF2dsrN5yZ6lrJ2eYriivs%2BsZGumlGKvoq7YaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
