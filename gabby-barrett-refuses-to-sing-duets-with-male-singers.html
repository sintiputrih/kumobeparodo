The “Cowboy Back” singer, 23, admitted that she won’t accept male duets out of respect for her husband,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cade Foehner</a>,&nbsp;</strong>27. In fact, she admitted that she’s turned down “large song opportunities” for duets with men, because of her commitment to her husband.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Gabby opened up about her reason for not singing duets with men during an appearance on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Unexpected</a>&nbsp;podcast, hosted by&nbsp;Dan + Shay’s&nbsp;<strong>Shay Mooney’s&nbsp;</strong>wife&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hannah</a>,&nbsp;</strong>on Monday, December 18. “I listen to what he has to say and I think he deserves that,” she said, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Life and Style</a>. “There’s been songs that are just not appropriate to sing wording-wise.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gabby-barrett-wont-sing-male-duets-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The “Growin’ Up Raising You” singer admitted that some of the songs that she’s turned down are <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“love songs</a> that are really intimate.” Gabby continued and said that when an artist accepts a song there’s often much more than just singing together that goes with the interviews. “When you accept a song, there’s that goes along with it, that you could sing it on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>award shows together,</a> you might be doing interviews together,” she said. “What does that look like on the stage? What does that dynamic look like?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Gabby explained that Cade’s feelings are a huge factor in why she won’t take those duets. “If I’m singing with another man, is that going to make my husband uncomfortable? Probably,” she said. “I respect [Cade] and love him so much that I’m not going to jeopardize my marriage to do a duet with somebody, you know. Like, I care about this a lot more and I pray and hope and know that God will bless my efforts in trying to keep my marriage straight, and not just for a duet or whatever it is.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Gabby and Cade first met while competing on season 16 of&nbsp;American Idol.&nbsp;In the interview, she also opened up about how they met and how quickly their relationship progressed. The pair have been married since October 2019, and they have <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two kids together</a> with a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>third on the way</a>. Cade also plays guitar in his wife’s live band.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5FrZqCZkpfGbq7Aq6merKRiv6ay1KycrGWkpHq0tc2gZJ2tlanAbsPIrZ9mpZGhsm6%2FyKeenqqjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
