You should. The film distributor Kino Lorber — known for its arthouse and international releases — launched its own channel on Prime Video in November. For $5.99 per month, the collection includes new Kino Lorber releases like Chile ’76 and Four Daughters along with hundreds of catalog titles from acclaimed filmmakers like Yorgos Lanthimos, Andrew Bujalski, Jia Zhangke, Jafar Panahi, and Todd Haynes. It’s a dense, diverse catalog, so we’ve picked out a few of its great films in a rotating guide to get you started.

A fascinating you-are-there look at a waterlogged nightmare becomes even richer with the director-provided context regarding how race and class impacted this national tragedy.</p>Trouble the Water <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Kino Film (Via Amazon)</a><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clri3ceda00v83b7yzm9exduw@published>Winter Sleep</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clri1ycw8002f3b7yjewspnre@published data-word-count=7><strong>Year: </strong>2014<br><strong>Runtime: </strong>3h 16m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Nuri Bilge Ceylan</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clri3cal800ut3b7y8oqxik2j@published data-word-count=74>The Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan is one of international cinema’s best, and the Kino Film Collection currently hosts one of his standout dramas, a 2014 film that won the Palme d’Or at Cannes. Set in Anatolia, it uses elements of Chekhov’s The Wife and Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov to tell its own character-driven story about class and power in Turkey. Don’t be thrown off by that epic running time. It’s worth every minute.</p>Winter Sleep <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Kino Film (Via Amazon)</a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Continue watching?</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cju9xmq5f00dhety60o7ce3mj@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title="Continue watching?"><span class=headline>30 Essential Movies to Stream on the Criterion Channel</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckaprt6og006npoy6tfxak3ne@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title="Continue watching?"><span class=headline>The 30 Best Movies on HBO and Max Right Now</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjs65vgz7014fcdyehlx6baxi@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title="Continue watching?"><span class=headline>The 30 Best Movies on Netflix Right Now</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>20 Must-See Movies on the New Kino Film Collection</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjsdKtZKanpp6ytHnKoqWoZZaeua55wqijpZ2Tqbawuo2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
