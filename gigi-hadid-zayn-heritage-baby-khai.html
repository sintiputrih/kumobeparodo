It’s something I’ve always thought about my whole life.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continued, “In certain situations, I feel—or I’m made to feel—that I’m too white to stand up for part of my Arab heritage. You go through life trying to figure out where you fit in racially. Is what I am, or what I have, enough to do what I feel is right? But then, also, is that taking advantage of the privilege of having the whiteness within me, right? Am I allowed to speak for this side of me, or is that speaking on something that I don’t experience enough to know?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that she believes Khai will nonetheless grow up feeling proud of her origins and intends for eventual discussions addressing such issues to take place organically. “I think that Khai will grow up feeling out the way that she can or wants to be a bridge for her different ethnicities,” Hadid said. “I think that it will be nice to be able to have those conversations, and see where she comes from [with] it, without us putting that onto her. What comes from her is what I’m most excited about, and being able to add to that or answer her questions, you know?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The model also opened up about her experience with pregnancy amid the pandemic. “There’s a bittersweetness because I know that, obviously, COVID has been such a tragedy for so many people and families, and lives, and jobs. But there was a silver lining in the timing, in that I got to experience pregnancy and giving birth and being with my baby, and it was a reset that I would have had to make for myself, regardless,” Hadid shared. “It really gave me time to experience motherhood the way I wanted to, which was without a baby nurse and without a nanny for as long as I could before I went back to work.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hadid and Malik confirmed the birth of their daughter on September 23, 2020. The model has since been public on Instagram about her new life in parenthood with Malik.
