Some of these signs are so blatantly obvious and theses signs happen to all of us almost every day,” Rain told the publication.</p><p>“It makes me feel better knowing that he is always with me. It is very comforting," she added.</p><p>The youngest Brown sibling explained the "signs" she gets from her dad who died in February after suffering a seizure in the family's Washington home.</p><p>“He comes through on the radio," she recalled. "It’s so strange because, even on the stations that don’t usually play this kind of music, I will turn on that station, or be flipping through the channels, you hear Stevie Ray on a station that does not play that kind of music."</p><p>She continued: "Or a song that will describe what is happening in my life. It will come on at the exact moment I am thinking about it or thinking about him. It is too strange to be coincidence."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>The matriarch's <a href=#>final moments and funeral arrangements</a> appeared on the Discover show in a recent episode.</p><p>Billy's son, Bear, 34, <a href=#>explained to HollywoodLife</a> why the family chose to air such intimate moments saying: “Dad loved the show and he loved the people so much!</p><p>“We think that the fans and everyone that loves the show deserves to see everything and to&nbsp;see his funeral and all.</p><p>“We discussed whether or not to include it and we felt like we should include it for sure because we believe that is what Dad would want.”</p><p>Bear also explained how he is doing in the death's aftermath: “I am doing alright. You think that you understand loss.</p><p>"I am just trying to keep one foot in front of the other.”</p><p>Reflecting on his father’s passing, <a href=#>Bear</a> said: “That was the hardest episode I have ever filmed.</p><p>“I broke down several times during the filming of this.</p><p>“My dad meant so much to me.</p><p>“I should have seen it coming because he had failing health for a while.</p><p>“It just seemed really sudden and out of the blue.”</p><h2><strong>TRAGIC PASSING</strong></h2><p>On the October 31st episode, Billy's daughter Snowbird, 26, <a href=#>got emotional</a> about the moment she realized she was going to lose her father.</p><p>Snowbird recalled being told by emergency services that they couldn't put Billy in the helicopter because his heart was too weak.</p><p>She teared up as she remembered the family were told to say their goodbyes when Billy was still alive.</p><p>"The helicopter came and they assessed it and he was too bad to take him in the helicopter.</p><p>"They couldn’t continue CPR on him or take him anywhere because his heart wouldn’t beat on its own.</p><p>"So they told us while he was still alive that we should say our goodbyes."</p><p>Later on Snowbird confided: "I know dad would want for us not to be sad, and to go on. But honestly going forward seems impossible because every day seems like a nightmare that I cant wake up from. Or hell."</p><p>The latest episode covered the events of that day and the void that Billy left behind as his wife and kids struggled to come to terms with his loss.</p><p>Billy also shared kids Matthew, 38,&nbsp;<a href=#>Joshua "Bam Bam" Brown</a>, 37,&nbsp;<a href=#>Gabe,</a>&nbsp;31, and&nbsp;<a href=#>Noah</a>, 28, with wife&nbsp;<a href=#>Ami</a>, 58.</p><h2><strong>DEVASTATING LOSS</strong></h2><p>In a series of 911 calls exclusively obtained by The Sun,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alaskan Bush People</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">crew members were on the scene when the seizure occurred.</a></p><p>Footage from the&nbsp;<a href=#>incident features members of the family shouting: "Wake up dad!</a>"</p><p>As The Sun previously reported, CPR was performed unsuccessfully.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The TV star had been in and out of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hospital in recent years</a>&nbsp;and was previously told by medical professionals that the high altitude wasn't good for him.</p><p>The father-of-seven decided to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">defy doctor's orders</a>&nbsp;and continue to live in the mountains with his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000677610106.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000597877036-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000596077265.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Alaskan Bush People’s Snowbird breaks down as she recalls moment she was told to say goodbye to dying dad Billy Brown</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsYWWAdnyYaJilmaOgrq95wa6qoWWgmryxuMRmmaKknK56o77OsKVmm5%2Biura6yJyYrZ2jYr%2BisMioZKuZmaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
