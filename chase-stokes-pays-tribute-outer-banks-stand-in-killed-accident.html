Your life was just starting. We JUST talked about how pumped you were about your tunes, how far you’d come with that ole 6 string and your want to keep creating art. Always always making others hearts warm and being so damn selfless.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Chase-Stokes-ss-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Chase continued, ruminating on the shock of AJ’s death, which happened in Charleston, South Carolina, around 2:30 AM, according to witnesses. He was reportedly hit by two separate cars, both of which fled the scene. “I wish I had more words to say right now, but the past day has been a struggle to say the least,” Chase continued in his emotional message. “We all love you, you touched all of our lives and made us all better people, and for that — Thank you AJ. Fly high angel.” Chase concluded the message with a red heart emoji.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>AJ reportedly passed away from his injuries, following the hit and run incidents at a nearby hospital. No charges have been filed, but police are seeking further information about the car that struck him. The wildly popular <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Netflix series</a> is currently filming its third season in the area. Kimmie Stewart Casting issued their own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>statement via Facebook</a>, saying in part, “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Outer Banks crew & cast</a> suffered a terrible loss when AJ was stuck by two cars, that fled the scene early this morning. AJ was a beautiful, kind soul & a bright light every day on set.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>They continued, explaining his role on the popular teen series. “He moved to Charleston from New York to work as our John B photo double/stand in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>this season</a>. I cannot fathom the shock and tragedy of AJ’s sudden loss and our thoughts are with his family and friends during this difficult time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e49vZpygkaiybr%2FTqKKeq12lrrq%2FjK2popqlqbJuu9StnKtlkpa7rL%2BMrKuappRitq95yqKjpZ2UYq6kr8idnKesXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
