The New York Police Department and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have both refused to comment on whether or not an inquiry into the incident is underway. Masks are compulsory on New York City subways, according to the MTA. A man shouted “1776!” to a woman on the metro in a viral video. The woman can be heard informing him that he should be fined $50 for not wearing his mask at the start of the video. When he got closer, he could be heard mockingly shouting, “I’m so afraid!” in the woman’s face. “Please stay away from me, sir,” she murmured as he took a step back.</p><h3><span id=Incident8217s_Social_Impact>Incident’s Social Impact</span></h3><p>It was shared on Twitter and TikTok by Naviko and @Subway DJ, respectively. The woman wore a mask, whilst the man did not. “We need to discover out who this person is and where he works since this is very unacceptable,” Naviko wrote on Twitter. Today, a crazed # more antimask #Antivaxxer bullied an elderly woman on the #subway #NYC. “As people sought to figure out who the man in the video was, they saw images of him wearing the same attire at an anti-vaccine mandate event in New York City.”</p><p>According to their Twitter feed, the event was arranged by the New York Young Republican Club. The same person may be seen with him in both the images and the subway film. The rally was conducted in protest of New York City’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which requires proof of immunization to access restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and music festivals.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Ryan Bartels does not have an official presence on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><ul><li>The incident occurred on August 15, 2021.</li><li>Social media users shared photos of him donning the same clothing at an anti-vaccine mandate rally in New York City.</li><li>Ryan Bartels works as a product manager for CarMax.</li><li>Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is running for governor of New York, and Republican New York City mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa were among the speakers at the event.</li></ul><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>celebrities</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>William Shakespeare Burton</a></h3>William Shakespeare Burton estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
