LeBron's father,&nbsp;Anthony McClelland, had a long criminal record and wasn't around, evidenced by the fact that LeBron doesn't carry his name.

LeBron had very little consistency in his life. "I saw drugs, guns, killings; it was crazy," an 18-year-old LeBron told The Guardian. Of his school's 162 days, he missed 100. Around that time, LeBron's sport wasn't basketball, but football, which he played in school.&nbsp;</p><p>It was his coach,&nbsp;Frank Walker, who offered him and Gloria a break when he asked her if the boy could live with him.

I had shelter and food," LeBron said of Walker, whom he credits with introducing him to basketball.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1ibIZ0e9OhnGasopa7tLLOq6SarJmku267xWajnpqipLtutsCmnKxllqe8rnnCoaClnJikvKV506hkbG5drrKivtJmpqWcXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
