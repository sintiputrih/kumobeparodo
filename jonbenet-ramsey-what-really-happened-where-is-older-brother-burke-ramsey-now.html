Here's why JonBenet Ramsey's brother was suspected of bludgeoning pageant</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Content Warning: Violence</strong></p><p>The murder of six-year-old beauty pageant star JonBenet Ramsey occurred in December 1996, yet more than 24 years later, the case still captivates many of us, as a killer has not been determined yet. JonBenet was found bludgeoned, strangled and hidden underneath a white blanket with a nylon cord around her neck. Her wrists were bound above her head while her mouth was covered in duct tape.</p><p>The murder is the subject of the latest documentary from discovery+, 'JonBenet Ramsey: What Really Happened'.</p><p>Her father, John Ramsey had first reported her missing, and a few hours later, found her body in the Ramsey household's basement. Because her body was found in the house itself, the Ramseys were suspects until retired detective Lou Smit helped clear them. Years later, a CBS documentary alleged that JonBenet's older brother, who was just nine years old at the time may be responsible.</p><h2 class=split>Why Burke Ramsey sued CBS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/5a698cd3-0935-45c0-8fa4-4b82ec57ce31.jpeg><p>In 2016, Burke <a href=# rel>sued</a> CBS for $750 million for being accused of murdering his sister in 'The Case Of: JonBenet Ramsey' — $250 million in compensatory damages and no less than $500 million in punitive damages. He also sued Werner Spitz, the forensic pathologist involved in the CBS docuseries for $150 million. CBS and Burke settled the defamation lawsuit for an undisclosed amount in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, Burke appeared on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">'Dr Phil'</a>, in which he answered in the negative to the eponymous host's question as to whether he killed his sister. When Dr Phil spoke about the theory that Burke's parents staged the kidnapping to cover-up their alleged involvement in JonBenet's death, Burke responded, "I don’t know what to say to that, because I know that’s not what happened. There have been people who have said that it’s not even possible for a nine-year-old to do that."</p><p>Burke also spoke about who he thought was most likely to have killed his sister, saying, "I kinda always thought it was a pedophile who saw her in one of the pageants and snuck in [to our house], who knows."</p><h2 class=split>Where is Burke Ramsey now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a14879ce-65fd-4a40-93dd-3532f04c3c5c.jpg><p>Burke Ramsey, born in 1987, attended Purdue University, where he studied computer technology, graduating in 2009. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">InTouch Weekly</a>, Burke lives a quiet life. Employed as a software engineer, Burke opted to work from his home even before the pandemic so he could avoid being around other people in an office.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not known whether Burke Ramsey has a significant other in his life, however, in 2015, the Australian news outlet, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">news.com.au</a> shared a social media photo showing Burke with a woman the outlet claimed was his girlfriend at the time. Following his appearance on 'Dr Phil' in 2016, Burke has stayed out of the limelight and has not done any other media appearances.</p><p>Burke's mother, Patsy Ramsey, died of ovarian cancer in 2006 at the age of 49.&nbsp;'JonBenet Ramsey: What Really Happened' will premiere on Discovery+ on Monday, January 4, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoop%2Bjr6a6xK1kq5mdqLK6edahmK1lopqurbjYZp%2BaqKCau6awjLCfnqqVYra0ec6lm56qXZe%2FsMDHnqlmmqWnuKZ50ZqkrJ2pYruwww%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
