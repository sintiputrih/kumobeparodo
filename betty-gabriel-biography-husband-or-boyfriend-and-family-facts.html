But, Betty is yet to break her silence on the issue, even though she keeps getting tickles from the buzzes of curiosity to voice out.</p><p>However, it is public knowledge that her place of birth is Washington D.C but she spent her formative years in Hyattsville, MD, and Pittsburgh. The popular actress’ ethnicity is Afro-American and it came to light via a tweet that her birthday falls on the 14th of October but her exact year of birth continues to elude the media.</p><p>Her educational background is an admirable one because, after her high school graduation, she joined IOWA University to study Animal Science/Vet, graduating with a Bachelors degree. In a bid to study acting, she moved to Chicago a while later and put many years into dancing and acting at various popular theaters like Steppenwolf and the Victory Gardens. Subsequently, she made the decision to proceed to the next level of her career, emerging as a Julliard graduate in no time at all. Although she is still trying to climb the success ladder, Betty Gabriel already has a short wiki page exclusive to her name.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-facts-%e2%80%93-husband-or-boyfriend></span><strong>Family Facts – Husband or Boyfriend</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On her family life, she is yet to disclose facts about both her parents and siblings, if any. In the same vein, she has maintained privacy on her personal life and is averse to spilling the beans on her romantic entanglements. Though she tries her best to keep her private affairs away from public scrutiny, she does not hesitate to flaunt her presence on her social media accounts from time to time.</p><p>However, Betty posted a picture with a guy called Jon Rich back in 2016 which gave rise to speculations that he was her boyfriend. The actress did not deem it necessary to speak on the matter, though for a long time now, Jon Rich’s photo has not resurfaced. Moreover, she has never appeared in public with any man that can be assigned the tag of a boyfriend. Her accounts on social media completely lack the presence of a likely or would-be partner. So, the obvious conclusion is that the film actress is presently unattached and concentrating on building a stellar professional life</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-facts-about-betty-gabriel></span><strong>Other Facts About Betty Gabriel</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>1</strong>.
