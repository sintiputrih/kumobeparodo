No way! When<strong> Whitney Port</strong> tied the knot with<strong> Tim Rosenman</strong> on Saturday, Nov. 7, the fashion designer and reality TV alum, 30, went for an edgy, unusual look. The City star’s custom-made gown, which featured a waterfall hemline was a collaborative design with Ashi Studio, was certainly out of the ordinary.&nbsp;</p><p>“At the start, Whitney saw a dress from the latest couture collection and she got inspired for an idea for her wedding dress,” <strong>Mohammad Ashi</strong> of Ashi Studio tells Us Weekly. “It was inspired by a vintage chandelier from Venice and Florence.”</p><p>Port’s gown, which featured a short front and long train, showed off her model-esque stems. The lace fabric and silver embroidery was decorated with small off-white pearls, using a beading technique called Zardozi.&nbsp;</p><p>Port kept her jewelry minimal and accessorized her bridal look with white gold, pearl, and diamond <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> by Delfina Delettrez. The pearl stud originally belonged to Rosenman's mother. She added a little more bling once she said her “I Do’s” with three Tacori wedding bands.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to walking down the aisle, she and her hubby shared a special “first look” moment, that was captured on film.&nbsp;</p><p>“She looked amazing and her dress was so spectacular,” Rosenman, who met Port on the set of The City, tells Us. “There was so much buildup to what her dress was going to look like because we kept it secret. I didn’t think it could possibly match the buildup, but I was blown away. She looked fantastic.”</p><p>In <a href=# rel=noopener>photographer <strong>Hannah Costello</strong></a>’s stunning desert photos, the Hills alum shines in her one-of-a-kind look. The entire soiree, held in the mountains of Palm Springs, Calif., was organized by BK Events, the wedding planning company of Whitney’s sister <strong>Ashley Port</strong>. &nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Tell Us: </strong>What do you think of Whitney Port's unique wedding dress?</p><p>For more exclusive photos and details from Whitney Port’s wedding, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6y1qsDNnrBmqJ%2BnwW7DwK2cq56RoblutMSmo6KmlWLEprDDoqWgZZSnsrS%2FjJupopyVYr2qr9OuqZ5lYmV%2Bdn2Qamho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
