Together for more than 20 years, they're clearly doing something right — along with constantly dodging dirt about infidelity and <a href=#>swinging</a>. When the topic of cheating came up during a&nbsp;<a href=#>Red Table Talk</a>&nbsp;episode, you best believe fans tuned in.</p><p>Sitting down with her mom, Adrienne Banfield-Jones, Jada opened up about her marriage to Will, explaining that while they've been faithful to one another, there have been other, unconventional betrayals. "I'm asked a lot about, 'Is there infidelity with your relationship with Will,' and I'm like, no, but there have been other betrayals of the heart that have been far bigger than I could even think in regards to an infidelity situation," she said.</p><p>Perhaps the secret to their successful union is the fact that they've stopped looking at marriage in a conventional sense. In <a href=#>another episode</a>&nbsp;of RTT, the Gotham actress revealed that she and her beau have even stopped celebrating momentous occasions, such as their anniversary and New Year's Eve. "It's more of a life partnership," she explained. "We don't really celebrate that day — You know what I'm saying? — anymore in that sense because the context of our union is totally different." Considering this <a href=#>glamorous duo</a> has been married since 1997, we applaud whatever works for the power couple.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam1nZn11e8mam5ploJ67rLHTrWSspZmptbR5waKeoJ2jqXqzscNmq5qanJp6ta3LpGScp56bsrS%2FyKilrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
