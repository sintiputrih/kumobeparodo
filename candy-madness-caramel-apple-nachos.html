I am literally like a kid in the candy store and I can’t wait to hit publish on this post because these are such a heavenly treat!</p><p>About 10 years ago, I was asked to bring 30 caramel apples to a Halloween get together. &nbsp;I bought the largest Granny Smith apples I could find, made my caramel from scratch, and loaded them up with all kinds of good stuff. But there was a problem! The caramel started to slide off the apples and half of it ended in a big pool at the bottom of my apple. So much for them being pretty! I sheepishly took them to the party anyway.</p><p>There were 30 kids, who were already on a certifiable sugar high, attempting to eat these humongous apples. There was not a chance in the world they would ever finish them! We ended up with 30 half eaten apples and I ended up throwing them away. I thought there must be a better way!</p><p>Fast forward to my present life. I have two kids in braces and despite their love for caramel apples, they wouldn’t dream of biting into one. Hence the beginning of Caramel Apple Nachos. Let the braces wearing people everywhere let out a huge sigh of relief!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0041-copy.jpg alt="Candy Madness Caramel Apple Nachos by Modern Honey.

Let me tell you something….once you start eating an apple drizzled in caramel, it’s hard to go back to just an ordinary apple.</p><p>These Candy Madness Caramel Apple Nachos solve that dilemma. Every single apple slice is coated with so much goodness that you end up satisfied with every single bite!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0001-copy.jpg alt="Candy Madness Caramel Apple Nachos by Modern Honey.

Very simple.</p><p>You start with a crisp apple such as a Granny Smith (the usual favorite) or a&nbsp;Honeycrisp.</p><p>Then you drizzle the apple slices with homemade salted caramel or melted store-bought caramels. At that point, these Caramel Apple Nachos are already good but let’s take them up a notch.</p><p>You finish them off by drizzling with melted white chocolate and then top with your favorite candy bars – Snicker’s, Heath Bar Toffee Bits, M & M’s, Reese’s Pieces, Butterfinger, and even Chocolate Covered Pretzels. This is where it gets fun because you can tailor make these caramel apple nachos to your taste buds. These are caramel apples on steroids. I kid you not.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0086-copy.jpg alt="Candy Madness Caramel Apple Nachos by Modern Honey.

You can either toss them with lemon juice, dip them in lemon water, or sprinkle with <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00EYFKKZC data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow><span><strong>Fruit Fresh</strong></span></a> to keep them from turning brown.</li><li><strong>Low and slow wins the race</strong>. When melting white chocolate, do it over a double-boiler or in the microwave at a low power. I will usually reduce the power on my microwave to 50%. Cook it at 30 second intervals, stirring after each time to ensure you don’t burn the white chocolate. Adding a few drops of coconut oil or shortening will help it melt better and make the melted white chocolate nice and shiny.</li><li>Homemade or Store Bought? You can <strong>make your own caramel from scratch</strong> (recipe below), buy Kraft caramels, or go to Trader Joe’s and pick up&nbsp;their caramel in a jar.</li><li><strong>Use a crisp apple</strong> such as Granny Smith or Honeycrisp.</li><li>Make your <strong>Caramel Apple Nachos Bar</strong>. Put all of the ingredients in bowls and let your guests make their own plate of nachos. They can customize their own with their favorite toppings.</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0016-copy.jpg alt="Candy Madness Caramel Apple Nachos by Modern Honey.

Once mixture reaches a medium amber color, add butter and whisk until butter is melted. Once it's melted, immediately remove pan from heat. Wait 10 seconds and then add heavy cream.
