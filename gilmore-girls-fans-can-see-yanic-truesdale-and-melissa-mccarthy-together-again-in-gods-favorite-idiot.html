McCarthy played Sookie St. James, talented chef and best friend to Lauren Graham’s Lorelai Gilmore, while Truesdale played the <a href=#>sassy and French inn concierge, Michel Gerard</a>. Gilmore Girls fans came to love Sookie and Michel’s friendly bickering.</p><p>Now, six years after Truesdale and McCarthy’s last scene together in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, fans can see them together again. Both actors star in Netflix’s new comedy series, God’s Favorite Idiot. Here’s what to know about the series and this mini Gilmore Girls reunion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gods-favorite-idiot-melissa-mccarthy-yanic-truesdale-1200x800.jpg><h2 id=h-what-is-god-s-favorite-idiot-about>What is ‘God’s Favorite Idiot’ about?</h2><p>God’s Favorite Idiot follows a tech support employee named Clark, played by McCarthy’s husband, Ben Falcone. After Clark is suddenly struck by lightning, he and his girlfriend, Amily (McCarthy), discover that he now has some sort of angelic glow. Clark and his friends believe he could be experiencing a divine power from God.</p><p>Much to Clark’s surprise, an angel named Chamuel (Truesdale) visits him to reveal that God has chosen him to become a messenger and save people from an impending apocalypse. But there’s one problem: Clark isn’t so sure he can handle that kind of pressure. Will God’s favorite idiot save the day?</p><p>Falcone created God’s Favorite Idiot, and he and McCarthy both serve as executive producers. The first eight episodes arrived on Netflix on June 15. Eight more episodes are on the way, but Netflix has yet to announce a release date.</p><h2>Yanic Truesdale shared what it was like to reunite with Melissa McCarthy after ‘Gilmore Girls’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=3.3228346456693><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g48NhGOUQbo</a><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/g48NhGOUQbo?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p>Truesdale jumped on board right away when McCarthy and Falcone asked him to join God’s Favorite Idiot. The actor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TVLine</a> that he was excited to work with McCarthy again, especially because of how comfortable they became with each other on Gilmore Girls.</p><p>“We got to know each other while working and discovering each other’s sensibility and talent and hanging out on set for 16 hours a day. So for me, the idea of reteaming and going back to that happy place where we got to know each other was very, very thrilling,” Truesdale said.</p><p>Plus, The Wedding Planners star couldn’t wait to see McCarthy at work after so many years. Her career took off after Gilmore Girls, having <a href=#>starred in hit movies</a> like Spy, The Heat, Bridesmaids, and dozens more.</p><p>“It was intriguing for me — who had known her for 22 years when&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;was her first TV show — to see how it would be on set with her now that she [has] this body of work and this experience,” Truesdale added. “She was also producing the show with Ben, so I was curious to see how she was as a producer. It was very fun for me to see her in action.”</p><h2>Yanic Truesdale and Melissa McCarthy want 1 other ‘Gilmore Girls’ star to join them in ‘God’s Favorite Idiot’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy 20th anniversary Gilmore Girls!!
