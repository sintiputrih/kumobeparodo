He had entrusted very few people about his health status but revealed that a few close ones used the knowledge to extort the actor for up to $10 million over the years in order to keep quiet. "What people forget is that's money they're taking from my children ... I trusted them and they were deep in my inner circle, and I thought they could be helpful. My trust turned to their treason," Sheen shared. The "Young Guns" star admitted that a prostitute that he had slept with took a picture of his anti-retroviral medication and threatened to sell it to the tabloids. By coming out with the news, Sheen told Matt Lauer, "I release myself from this prison today."</p><p dir=ltr>Despite Sheen declaring that he had disclosed that he had HIV with his partners, <a href=#>Radar</a> reported that multiple women had come forward claiming that they weren't informed by the actor. One unnamed ex-girlfriend sued the actor, accusing him of exposing her to HIV, per <a href=#>TMZ</a>. Sheen settled out of court and agreed to pay her $120,000 in $10,000 monthly installments over the course of a year. While the settlement and extortions caused a dip in his bank account, Sheen's further antics cause him to lose out on acting jobs, causing his net worth to drop significantly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkaIB6gY6hprBlk52us7jInmSsoJWau264zqyrZqufYrq2r8dmpKimla58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
