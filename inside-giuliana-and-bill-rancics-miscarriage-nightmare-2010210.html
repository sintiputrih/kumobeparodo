We had confided in people and told them, and we were just thrilled."</p><p>Added Bill, 39: "You could see it in the doctor's eyes that he had news he didn't want to tell us, but he had to. It was a miscarriage."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the devastating news, the couple — who wed in 2007 — admits they eventually came to terms with their situation and remain hopeful they will one day become parents.</p><p>"It was several months of guilt and sadness," Giuliana said.
