The news has sent ripples of grief through the community, as friends, family, and patrons come to terms with the loss of a beloved figure whose presence was synonymous with warmth, hospitality, and culinary excellence.</p><p>Tom’s legacy extends far beyond the doors of Moretti’s Restaurant; it is interwoven with the very fabric of the community he served. To pay respects and share fond memories, friends and family are invited to the Walter J. Kent funeral home on Lake Street and Washington Ave on Thursday, January 4th, from 4-7 pm.

The spiritual ceremony will be an opportunity for all who knew Tom to come together, seek comfort, and reflect on the profound impact he had on their lives.</p><p>Following the church service, a commitment prayer and internment, accompanied by military honors, will take place in St. Peter & Paul’s Cemetery.
