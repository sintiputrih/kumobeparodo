It looks like we’ll get to see some of our favorite characters, like Judy’s parents, Clawhauser, Bogo, and Flash in a whole bunch of fun situations.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Despite their joy, several fans of Zootopia had a much darker take on the announcement, expressing their desire for Judy’s abortion in the infamous fan comic “I Will Survive” to somehow become canon in the series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>finally we'll see judy's abortion <a href=#>https://t.co/npwxA6FFNt</a></p>— David M Willis! (@damnyouwillis) <a href=#>November 12, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>For those who don’t know, “I Will Survive” gained full-on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">meme status</a> in 2017 after the artist known as Borba uploaded it to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DeviantArt</a>. The comic features Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde from the movie in a relationship that results in Judy becoming pregnant with their child.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>While Hopps is concerned with the safety of having an interspecies birth and how things may affect her career, Wilde argues in favor of keeping the baby. After a dramatic fight, the couple breaks up.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>We understand if your head is spinning right now. It’s a lot to take in that someone would want to draw such an intense take on the wholesome family storyline. But what if we told you that the comic then spawned a sequel that confirmed not only Hopps getting the abortion, but her beginning a lesbian relationship?</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>“Born to Be Alive” was published back in 2018 after the artist had already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tried to convince others</a> that the previous comic wasn’t pro-life. He shared his concerns about the controversy that the previous comic had caused.</p><p>“I Will Survive&nbsp;created a fuss surrounding the issue of abortion and a great deal of shitposting in the comment areas. I said it was a fuss because the comic was about a breakup and what caused it, with the abortion theme working just as the contentious matter that triggered the intense argument between Nick and Judy. Anyway, I hope the moods are calmer now and that this sequel won’t be considered as controversial as&nbsp;IWS&nbsp;was.”</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=67 data-injectable=false>Oh, and the series doesn’t end there — it gets even wilder.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>the abortion comic ended with judy being assassinated like JFK</p>— E-Girls Posting Their L’s Online (@EGirlsPostingLs) <a href=#>November 12, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=true>“Never Say Goodbye” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">featured</a> a storyline that had Hopps reliving a Zootopia-themed version of the JFK assassination. Borba discussed his reservations about posting the latest comic on his DeviantArt blog.</p><p>“I ended up deciding to publish it right here on DA rather than on my website, despite my reservations about doing so due to the avalanche of personal attacks and s**tposting that IWS and BTBA received in their respective comment areas. The decision was correct; as I expected the time passed and the unwanted presence was gone, their ill-natured attention going to another targets, leaving these my Zootopia fan comics in peace.”</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>With the new announcement of Zootopia+, however, it looks like he may not get the peace he was hoping for. Tons of Twitter users have been referencing the comic after the latest announcement, likely driving tons of people to check out the infamous comics.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>the end of the judy abortion comic resulted in more zootopia 😧 <a href=#>https://t.co/fXphJvHfp8</a></p>— cj (@drukkarist) <a href=#>November 12, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=47 data-current-count=47 data-injectable=false>Yeah, that’s pretty understandable…</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'll never be able to consume Zootopia content after that goddamn comic <a href=#>https://t.co/ADrJojk4e7</a></p>— Tiquext (@Struppiii) <a href=#>November 12, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Don’t worry, you aren’t the only one surprised that these comics exist.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>tf is this judy hopps abortion comic in hearing about 😭😭😭</p>— overcome with grief, pain, & heartbreak (@prttyfun) <a href=#>November 12, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=377 data-injectable=false>It really would be a lot to ask of Disney Plus to get all these things right.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>but will we see her become the first openly bisexual president? will we see her assassination??</p><p>frankly I don't trust disney to do the right thing and tell the WHOLE story</p>— 💛🥚💜🖤 (@Egg_Tats) <a href=#>November 12, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>If you want to read “I Will Survive” for yourself to see just how wild and intense it is, it’s available for free on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DeviantArt</a>.
