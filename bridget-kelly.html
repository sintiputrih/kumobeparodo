Following the bitterness that their union was going through, their relationship ended being telecasted on TV.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Bridget shared about the fallout of their relationship stating James was unfaithful; however, she still wanted to work things out. Kelly expressed,</p><p>“The unfaithfulness on his side came around right before our breakup,” Kelly told BOSSIP. “I didn’t want that to be broadcast because it looks petty, like I’m trying to justify my behavior. I wanted to work it out because I felt so guilty about my past transgressions that I wasn’t about to throw him under the bus on TV.”</p><p>On the other hand, James has another story to share, as he claims that Kelly, previously cheating on him with multiple affairs, probably played a part in their split. Well, Kelly did open up about cheating James once or twice, back in time. So, it sounds legitimate of James stating the very reason behind their breakup. But, it’s difficult to conclude as to who is the one at significant fault in their relationship. Is it Kelly who did wrong, or, James screwed things up?

The real that comes with it.”</p><p>Kelly credits the funky production on “Sedated” for allowing her to reflect on both sides of the coin when speaking about love: “The production on ‘Sedated’ really lends to this, with the funk influences that represent the edge needed to both avoid and endeavor upon love at the same time.”</p><p>In the video for “Sedated,” the singer attempts to quash her conflicted feelings by singing away her heartaches, with her band in tow. “All I really want is to love and not to fear/ It can take a broken heart, so I guess I’m staying here,” she fervently belts.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p>“The video was shot to capture the different sides of someone experiencing this dilemma,” she says. “It’s sexy, angry, restless and bold all at the same time. My video director Isaac Yowman used some cool visual effects to creatively captured that internal struggle.”</p><h2>Bridget Kelly Contacts</h2><h2>Related Biographies</h2><p>You may also like to read the <strong>Bio, Career, Family, Relationship, Body measurements, Net worth, Achievements</strong>, and more about:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span> <span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
