A quick perusal of the label's new arrivals section is all it takes to have your wish list blow up with essentials for the upcoming season.</p><h2 id=how-amp-other-stories-came-about>How & Other Stories Came About</h2><p>At the very beginning, the H&M team behind the secret project, Stories, initially envisioned it as a way to promote a new beauty line, but they soon realized they had a lot more to say. As a result, the name & Other Stories comes from the fact that the authors always intended for their work to be an assortment of tales told from different perspectives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They're running three design studios in other parts of the world to double down on this goal. While their main office and most of their designers are in Stockholm, Sweden, they also have a branch in Los Angeles, California, that focuses on ready-to-wear.
