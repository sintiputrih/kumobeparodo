In his YouTube channel, he uploads flipbook animation, short movies, stop-motion animation, and song mashups.</p><p>Andy fell in love with animation as a kid and has been doing it ever since. He has worked on many Oscar-nominated movies such as ParaNorman, The Boxtrolls, and Kubo and the Two Strings. Speaking of his YouTube channel, Andy has more than 3 million subscribers and over 390 million people have already watched his videos.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_It_All_Began></span>How It All Began<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As a kid, Andy fell in love with the magic of animation so, he started animating from an early age. He was specifically interested in flipbook animation and stop-motion. In fact, as a kid, he had made tons of flipbooks and experimented with stop-motion. When he grew up, he studied filmmaking and began working professionally as a stop-motion animator. With such remarkable skills, he got the opportunity to work with LAIKA.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Andymation-working.jpg><p>In addition to that, Andy Bailey’s wife <strong>Laurie Bailey</strong> was the one with the idea of creating a kit for creating flipbook animation. Andy loved the idea and started off by creating some samples of it. His sample spread like fire, and soon, he created more of them. Now he is selling his kit on his personal website.</p><p>Andy says that flipbook animation is so simple that anyone can do it. You make a few drawings flip the paper, and your picture comes to life right there in front of your eyes, it’s magic says, Andy. Before finding the perfect paper, he tried a lot of light pad for tracing. Finally, after a lot of trial and error, he finally found the ideal tracing paper. After his kit was finally ready, Andy and his lovely wife ran a successful campaign on Kickstarter.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kickstarter></span>Kickstarter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter</a> is a website that helps people who are artists, musicians, filmmakers, designers, and other creators to find the resources and support they need to make their ideas a reality. Andy first started providing the people with the tool and knowledge of making flipbook animations with the help of Kickstarter. Basically, he provides a kit named &nbsp;Andymation’s Flipbook Kit that contains all the information needed to create their own flipbook animation. He has generated over $75K from selling his kit to over a thousand people.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>My new Flipbook Animation Kit is live on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@Kickstarter</a>!
