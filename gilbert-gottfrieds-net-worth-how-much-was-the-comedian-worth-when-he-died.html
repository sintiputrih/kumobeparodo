Some of the star's wealth came from his appearances in films like "Problem Child" and "Beverly Hills Cop II," per <a href=#>IMDb</a>. In all, he has 184 acting credits to his name, but perhaps the most popular film Gottfried was part of was "Aladdin." The comedian famously voiced the parrot Iago in the blockbuster smash. It's not entirely clear how much he made for the 1992 film, but Disney is known to shell out plenty of money to talent, like&nbsp;<a href=#>paying Owen Wilson $2.5 million</a> to lend his voice in "Cars 2."</p><p dir=ltr>The actor also starred in <a href=#>"USA Up All Night"</a> alongside Rhonda Shear from 1989 to 1998. In addition, Gottfried appeared regularly on "Hollywood Squares." According to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a>, it was "the most expensive game show ever produced," costing nearly $25 million a year. Some of the operating costs went directly to celebrities, but again, the figures are murky. The star likely made a good amount of money in stand-up comedy, and he also <a href=#>famously voiced the Aflac duck</a>, <a href=#>though the company canned Gottfried</a> from the gig in 2011 after a controversial joke.</p><p dir=ltr>According to a 2015 interview, <a href=#>Gottfried resided in the Chelsea neighborhood</a> of New York with his wife, Dara Gottfried, and their two kids. After Gottfried had such a humble upbringing, Dara suggested it would be a good idea to invest in real estate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWtgaIF4e8aio5udoql6qLvTrZ2roZWZwG66xK1ksKeiqbVutM6wZKatk516uK3SZquhnV2YvK6xw6KYp2WnpL%2B1tIywn56mXZ2ybrDInpto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
