Simpson</strong></a>, who was accused of murdering Goldman in 1994, died at age 76.</p><p>Simpson “died without penance,” the attorney said in a statement on Thursday, April 11, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>AP</a>.</p><p>Simpson’s family <a href=#>confirmed his death</a> on Thursday following a battle with cancer.</p><p>“On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to <a href=#>his battle with cancer</a>. He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren,” read a statement shared via X. “During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace.”</p><p>While Simpson originally gained fame as an NFL star, his time in the public eye also included controversy. He was linked to the 1994 murder of his ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Nicole Brown Simpson</strong></a> and Goldman, who was a friend of Brown Simpson.</p><p>Brown Simpson, who was 35 at the time of her death, and Goldman, who was only 25, were fatally stabbed in California, and Simpson was subsequently arrested.</p><p>Following the trial of the century — which has since been documented in FX’s American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson — Simpson was acquitted of the murder charges in 1995. He was later found guilty for wrongful death and battery against Goldman in a civil suit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/OJ-Simpson-s-Died-Without-Penance-Says-the-Late-Ron-Goldman-s-Family-Attorney-574.jpg><p>More than 20 years after Goldman’s death, his family reflected on the civil case against Simpson and how the criminal trial still haunts them.</p><p>“Despite us winning, it left us very empty. But I think it set an upward path for other victims and survivors. And I think it gave a lot of room for people to start rebuilding and healing when you get to be in the driver’s seat,” Ron’s father, <a href=#><strong>Fred Goldman</strong></a>, said during a February 2017 appearance on <a href=#>Good Morning America</a>. “I still, to this day, have a hard time with the fact that he wasn’t found guilty in the criminal trial. Everything was there. Everything was in place. But too much other junk got involved.”</p><p>Ron’s sister, <strong>Kim Goldman</strong>, added that there is still “no escaping it,” referring to the onslaught of coverage over her brother and Brown Simpson’s murders in the media.</p><p>“There’s been a lot of shows and a lot of programs and movies. … I don’t want to keep debating evidence,” she said on GMA. “I don’t want to keep <a href=#>rehashing testimony</a>. I don’t want to keep justifying and defending.”</p><p>The family also reflected on how upsetting it is that Ron’s life was cut short and all his “dreams” weren’t able to “come to fruition.”</p><p>Kim noted that while the sadness “lingers,” at least she can see her late sibling through her own children. “I have a 13-year-old son that has similar mannerisms,” she explained. “Sometimes he’ll do something I’m like, ‘God, my brother, used to do that.’ Or he has a freckle pattern that reminds me of my brother.”</p><p>While Ron’s death will stick with his loved ones forever, Simpson did eventually wind up behind bars for a different crime.</p><p>Simpson was arrested in 2007 and found guilty of kidnapping and armed robbery the following year. He was sentenced to serve nine to 33 years in prison.</p><p>The disgraced athlete was released on parole in December 2021 after serving the minimum sentence.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this year, Simpson made headlines when it was reported that he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. Simpson denied in February that <a href=#>he was in hospice care</a>, telling his social media followers at the time that he was “hosting a ton of friends for the Super Bowl” that month.</p><p>Simpson’s final X post was posted on Super Bowl Sunday, showing him wearing a San Francisco 49ers jersey in support of the team playing the Kansas City Chiefs, who ultimately won.</p><p>Simpson is survived by kids Arnelle, Jason, Aaren, whom he shared with <a href=#>first wife <strong>Marguerite Whitley</strong></a>, and Sydney and Justin, whom he welcomed with late ex-wife Brown Simpson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaoZZpiwKq5z6ymp2WUnrKledaiq6Gnpal6sbHNmqWcnV2orrq%2FjKump2WXpLmlucCnZJ%2BZnZ65unnLmq6ynaJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
