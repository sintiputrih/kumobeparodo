The Internet went nuts on Monday, Sept. 21, when a Photoshopped image of Ricci dressed as Morticia Addams went viral.</p><a href=#>http://thecreaturesenchantment.tumblr.com/post/129400374326/wednesday-addams-as-her-mother-morticia-addams</a><p>According to Yahoo, Ricci’s head was edited onto <strong>Anjelica Huston’s</strong> body from a photo taken in the ’90s. Clad in her black threads (oh, so dark!), Morticia has her hair slicked down and is resting her arm on a chair.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Christina on the red carpet</a></p><p>Ricci, 35, and Huston, 64, played goth mom and daughter in the adaptation of the ’60s-era TV show, which was first inspired by Charles Addams’ 40s-era illustrations. Back in April 2014, Ricci opened up about the memorable role, and how she never felt like the character was hard to shake off when seeking other job opportunities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I think that I’ve been very lucky that none of these images or impressions I’ve left on people have been bad ones really,” the former child actress told <a href=#>Parade</a> magazine. “People love Wednesday, but I would love that character too, so I’ve never really attempted to shake any of the stuff.”</p><p>She added: “I’ve always been very lucky to have characters that people really love. I think about some people that can’t shake really bad images and I’m glad I avoided them.”</p><p>Check out reactions to the photo below:</p><p>Julian Caesar (@Exit_The_Void): “Christina Ricci as Morticia Addams.
