Even with 2023's SAG-AFTRA strike strike and Writers Guild of America strike, things worked out for one of the biggest nights of awards season to have its time to shine and give the stars a chance to show up and show out on this year's red carpet. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emma Stone</a> has reason to celebrate at tonight's ceremony, as she's nominated for two awards: Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy for her role in Poor Things and Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Series - Drama in Showtime'sThe Curse. And naturally, when she arrived at tonight's show, she came ready to steal the spotlight and take home the gold.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stone arrived at the show wearing a plunging gown that featured strategically placed floral appliqu√©s. The gown was covered in delicate beading and featured a deep V and a high front slit, as well as a dramatic train. The dress's florals were in light pastel shades and she finished the look with simple, strappy satin heels. She wore her signature red hair down with flipped-out ends and pushed one side back to reveal dangling diamond earrings.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kevin Mazur/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Stone has a storied history with the Globes. Including this year's double nomination, she's been up for eight awards and has won one Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy for 2017's La La Land. Other Stone flicks that have been nominated include her breakout role in Easy A and 2022's Disney reimagining of 101 Dalmatians: Cruella.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After her win for La La Land, Stone dedicated her award to struggling actors and actresses everywhere. After her speech, she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Entertainment Tonight</a> that she felt lucky to be able to pursue her passion and be recognized for her work, saying, "It was interesting. I was 15 ... I don't know, I auditioned a lot and I was grateful to be out here because I was so lucky to be doing what I loved to do. But it was an interesting time for sure."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Alberto E.
