While the show was abruptly cancelled in 2013, Grimes previously revealed that a sixth season was supposed to jump five years into the future.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was about to leave my house to go to set [to film the season 5 finale] … The producers called and said, ‘Just so you know, the show’s not coming back.’ … I sat on my floor and I cried,” Grimes said in a previous YouTube video. “The way that it went down was shocking to everyone, and [we] had to scramble. I don’t think it gave fans the closure they wanted.”</p><p>After hanging up with the main cast in Wednesday’s video, Grimes called <strong>Dustin Milligan</strong>, who played Ethan Ward on season 1. Fans may recall that Ethan, who was love interest for both Grimes’ Annie and Stroup’s Silver, left with little explanation in between seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>Scroll through for everything we learned from the 90210 reunion — including the reason for Milligan’s premature exit:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BZwrTAyKdkpqGcobaorc1mqqGdnpaybrPRoqSeq12nsra6yK2cZp6fp3p6fJFqZ2ayn6S6boGMrZiknaeWxrR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
