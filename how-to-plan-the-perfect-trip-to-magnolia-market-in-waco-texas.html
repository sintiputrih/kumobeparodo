You can get first dibs of the freshly made baked goods and enjoy the grounds without the crowds. &nbsp;Another tip is to have someone wait in line while you park. &nbsp;I dropped off my son at the bakery to stand in line while we parked. This saved at least 10-15 minutes and by the time we arrived at the bakery, it was almost our turn to order. It went seamless and everyone was happy.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_6646.jpg alt="Silos Baking Company at Magnolia Market at the Silos.
