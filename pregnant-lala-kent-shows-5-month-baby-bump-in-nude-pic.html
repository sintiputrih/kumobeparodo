(The producer, 49, is already the father of daughters London, 10, and Rylee, 7, with his ex-wife,<a href=#><strong> Ambyr Childers</strong></a>.)</p><p>“I’m like shaking right now, because I can’t believe it’s a real-life thing,” the Give Them Lala Beauty creator said at the time. “I’m really emotional. … It’s very much happy tears.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Vanderpump-Rules-Pregnant-Lala-Kent-Shows-5-Month-Baby-Bump-in-Nude-Pic-1.jpg><p>The couple <a href=#>revealed the sex of their baby-to-be</a> later that same month with the help of a pink parachute. Kent, who was convinced she had a son on the way, exclusively told Us Weekly in September, “It was a bit of an adjustment. And then, like, I saw my mom and I just bawled because I’m like, ‘I get to have that. I get a little mini Lala,’ which then started freaking me out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Emmett chimed in at the time: “I feel like I’m really good with girls. And I feel like I’m old. If we had a boy, he would be Tarzan off the walls. And then this one would lose her mind when the Play-Doh was being thrown through the living room. Instead, now she’s going to get a little Lala and they can cuddle and watch movies and get their nails done.”</p><p>The couple went public with their relationship in 2018 and <a href=#>got engaged</a> in September of that same year. While they were set to tie the knot in April, they <a href=#>postponed their wedding ceremony</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602ajmqSRYrimutNmqqGnp6h6dnnMqKWtoF2XrqPFjJuspqhdnrtuutSdnGaomZh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
