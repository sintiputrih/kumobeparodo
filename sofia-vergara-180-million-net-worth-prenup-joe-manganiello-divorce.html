While details of their prenup have not been made public, it sounds like dividing their marital assets and earnings should be straightforward.</p><p id=elTSCGHMWO data-wc=53>Back in 2015, Sofia revealed that they would be keeping their financial matters separate once they tied the knot. Speaking to <strong>Howard Stern</strong> on his Sirius XM&nbsp;show, Sofia also said that Joe had no issue agreeing to a prenup. She said: <strong>"He said, 'Do whatever you want. I'll sign whatever you want.'"</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Sofia Vergara's net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/89dfcc152211-sofia-vergara-black-dress.jpg><p id=e9LMU5BMTu data-wc=59>It shouldn't come as a surprise that Sofia is said to be worth a staggering $180 million. She was the highest-paid TV actress in the world for multiple years thanks to her role on Modern Family, which saw her reportedly earn $500,000 per episode at the height of its success, meaning she was raking in $10 million a season.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eOTSC21Qpsb data-wc=20>She is also a judge on America's Got Talent&nbsp;and according to <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a>, she also makes $10 million per season.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Joe Manganiello's net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e903ec5ef13a-gettyimages-1388129854.jpg><p id=eORIRFxNDp data-wc=47>Joe is estimated to have a $40 million fortune thanks to his work as an actor, producer, and director.
