After Salt-N-Pepa disbanded, James acknowledged her issues and was driven to focus on healing herself.&nbsp;"I got to that desperate place where nobody could help me but God," James told&nbsp;<a href=#>The Star Tribune</a>. "That meant to me that I needed to shut down a lot of things and focus on God because that was where my healing was. I needed to take a beat for myself."&nbsp;</p><p>James' pastor told her that "change is not an event, it's a process," and those words of wisdom assisted James' path to overcome bulimia. Her husband, Gavin Wray, was there for her throughout her process and encouraged her to speak to a therapist. "For me, the bulimia was about stuffing my emotions. So I stopped suppressing my feelings," James recalled, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Distractify</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As of this writing, after her&nbsp;tumultuous divorce from Wray,&nbsp;James isn't letting that change hold her back either. Even though the experience was painful, she told&nbsp;<a href=#>Newsday</a>&nbsp;that she would like to get back into the <a href=#>dating game</a>&nbsp;â€” that is, as long as men aren't intimidated by her success.&nbsp;"I haven't had a date yet, but I'm just putting it out there," James said. "People are afraid of celebrities. They're so intimidated, we barely get approached. It's a problem."<br></p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, please contact the National Eating Disorder Association's Helpline at 1-800-931-2237 or chat with one of their helpline volunteers on <a href=#>NEDA</a>'s website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGloZoBye9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2orq3AjJ%2BpqKVdqK6twIynZKmdoJZ6qLvTZpuirp%2BnsKawjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 FluxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
