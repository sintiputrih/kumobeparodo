The release also comes after Lil Tecca's 2021 album, We Love You Tecca 2. The LP saw collaborations from the artist with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Chief Keef</a>, Trippie Redd, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Gunna</a>, and more.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tecca-taps-90s-r-b>Tecca Taps '90s R&B</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We Love You Tecca 2 acted as a follow-up to his 2019 debut mixtape, We Love You Tecca. The mixtape featured a collaboration with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Juice WRLD</a> shortly before his death in December of 2019, on the track "<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ransom</a> (Remix)." The track being pulled from SoundCloud for copyright infringement in August of 2019 sparked a reaction from the young rapper. Lil Tecca said on Instagram Live, "How you gon’ copyright me???" Also adding, "This is literally me!" The collaboration put the young rapper on the map, with "Ransom (Remix)" peaking at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. A Cole Bennett-directed music video also accompanies the song. In response to the song's success, Lil Tecca also pledged to keep "grinding like [he's] still getting 100 plays."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lil Tecca additionally tweeted, "album this summer," earlier this month, leading to fans in the comments expressing their excitement. One user responded with, "TECCA SUMMER TAKEOVER," with another calling for the artist to "drop that shit today!" In January of this year, the artist also unveiled his upcoming album's title in a tweet to fans that simply read, "TEC the ALBUM."
